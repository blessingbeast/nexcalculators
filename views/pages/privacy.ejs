            <h3 style="color: #0f172a; margin-top: 0;">1. Introduction</h3>
            <p style="color: #475569; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                At NexCalculators, your privacy is our priority. We understand that you use our calculators to process
                sensitive information—from your salary details to your health metrics. This Privacy Policy outlines
                clearly how we handle your data (Spoiler: We don't).
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: #0f172a;">2. No Data Collection</h3>
            <p style="color: #475569; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <strong>We operate on a "Client-Side First" architecture.</strong> This means:
                <br>
                - When you calculate your BMI, Salary, or SIP returns, the math happens 100% inside your browser using
                JavaScript.
                <br>
                - No data is sent to our servers.
                <br>
                - We do not store, save, or view the numbers you input. Once you close the tab, your data is gone
                forever.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: #0f172a;">3. Cookies</h3>
            <p style="color: #475569; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                We use minimal cookies purely for website functionality (like remembering your Dark Mode preference). We
                use third-party tools like Google Analytics to track anonymous page views (e.g., "100 people visited the
                BMI page today"), but these tools cannot see the specific values you entered.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: #0f172a;">4. Third-Party Links</h3>
            <p style="color: #475569; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                Our website may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed
                to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. We strongly advise you to review
                the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the
                content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: #0f172a;">5. Changes to This Policy</h3>
            <p style="color: #475569; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 0;">
                We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
                this page.
