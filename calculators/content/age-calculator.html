    <h1>Age Calculator: The Science of Time Tracking</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        "How old are you?" is one of the most common questions we are asked. Usually, we answer with a simple number:
        "I'm 25" or "I'm 40". But time is continuous and precise. You aren't just 25; you are 25 years, 3 months, 12
        days, and some odd hours old. This <strong>Age Calculator</strong> is designed to bridge the gap between rough
        estimates and chronological precision. It navigates the complexities of the Gregorian calendar—leap years,
        varying month lengths, and date boundaries—to give you your exact age definition today.
    </p>

    <h2>The Complexity of Calculating Age</h2>
    <p>
        It might seem simple: Current Year minus Birth Year. <br>
        <em>2024 - 1990 = 34.</em><br>
        But this simple math fails because it ignores the specifics of months and days. If today is January 1st, 2024,
        and you were born on December 31st, 1990, the simple math says 34, but you barely turned 33 yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
        True age calculation requires an algorithm that accounts for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Variable Month Lengths:</strong> January has 31 days, April has 30, and February changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Leap Years:</strong> Every 4 years (mostly), an extra day is added. A person born on Feb 29th
            technically has a birthday only once every 4 years!</li>
        <li><strong>Time Zones:</strong> Being born in Tokyo vs New York can technically shift your birth "date"
            relative to UTC.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Do We Need Exact Age Calculation?</h2>
    <p>
        Beyond curiosity, exact age is critical in legal and administrative contexts:
    </p>
    <h3>1. Job Eligibility</h3>
    <p>Many government jobs and competitive exams have strict age limits (e.g., "Candidate must not be older than 28
        years as of 1st Aug 2024"). A difference of one day can disqualify a candidate.</p>

    <h3>2. School Admissions</h3>
    <p>Primary school admissions often have strict cut-offs. A child needs to be exactly 5 or 6 years old by a specific
        date to enter Grade 1.</p>

    <h3>3. Retirement & Pension</h3>
    <p>Vesting of pension benefits happens on specific dates. Knowing exactly when you cross the 60-year threshold helps
        in financial planning.</p>

    <h3>4. Astrological Precision</h3>
    <p>Astrology and Kundali matching require age (and birth time) precision down to the minute to plot planetary
        positions.</p>

    <h2>Fun Facts About Age</h2>
    <p>Did you know?</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Korean Age:</strong> In South Korea, traditionally, a baby was considered 1 year old at birth
            (counting time in the womb) and turned a year older every New Year's Day, not on their birthday. (Though
            they recently switched to the international system).</li>
        <li><strong>Feb 29 Babies:</strong> "Leaplings" often celebrate birthdays on Feb 28th or March 1st in non-leap
            years. Legally, most countries recognize March 1st as the age advancement date.</li>
        <li><strong>Seconds Alive:</strong> By the time you are 31 years and 7 months old, you have lived roughly 1
            Billion seconds!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Psychology of Age</h2>
    <p>
        Age is just a number, but it carries weight. We often mark life in "Decades"—turning 30, 40, or 50 are massive
        psychological milestones.
        <br><br>
        <strong>The "9-enders":</strong> Research suggests that people who are 29, 39, 49, etc., are more likely to make
        major life changes (like running a marathon or changing jobs) as they approach a new decade boundary. Using an
        age calculator can sometimes trigger this reflection on "time remaining" vs "time lived".
    </p>

    <h2>Biological vs Chronological Age</h2>
    <p>
        This calculator measures your <strong>Chronological Age</strong>—the amount of time that has passed since your
        birth.
        However, scientists also study <strong>Biological Age</strong>, which refers to how fast your cells are aging.
        Factors like stress, diet, and exercise can make your "body" younger or older than your calendar age. A fit
        50-year-old might have the biological markers of a 35-year-old!
    </p>

    <h2>How Our Calculator Works</h2>
    <p>
        Our tool uses the standard Western Age System.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>It takes your input date (DOB).</li>
        <li>It gets the current system date.</li>
        <li>It subtracts the years first.</li>
        <li>It then checks if the current month/day is <em>before</em> the birth month/day. If so, it subtracts 1 from
            the year count.</li>
        <li>It then calculates the remaining months and days, dynamically adjusting for previous month lengths (e.g.
            subtracting days from Feb vs March).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Time is our most valuable resource. Knowing exactly how much of it has passed helps us appreciate the journey.
        Whether you are calculating your age for a form, checking if your child is ready for school, or just realized
        you've been alive for 10,000 days, this tool provides the precision you need.

    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Does this calculator save my birth date?</h4>
            <p>Absolutely not. The calculation happens locally in your browser using JavaScript. No data is sent to our
                servers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. How do you handle 29th February?</h4>
            <p>If you were born on Feb 29, the calculator recognizes it as a valid date. In non-leap years, it
                calculates your anniversary relative to March 1st usually.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. Why am I 0 years old?</h4>
            <p>If the entered date is less than 12 months ago (e.g., for a baby), the calculator will show 0 Years and
                the corresponding months/days.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. What is the maximum age it can calculate?</h4>
            <p>It can calculate dates back to year 100 AD theoretically, but practically it is useful for dates from
                1900 onwards.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Can I calculate the age of my dog?</h4>
            <p>This gives chronological years. For "Dog Years" (where 1 human year ≈ 7 dog years), you would need a
                simplified multiplication of this result.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Is the result accurate to the second?</h4>
            <p>No, this tool calculates up to the Day. Calculating to the second requires knowing the exact Birth Time
                (e.g., 4:35 PM), which most people don't recall.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. Can I use this for legal documents?</h4>
            <p>While accurate, official age is usually determined by your birth certificate or passport. This tool is
                for informational and verification purposes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. Why does day count change?</h4>
            <p>Because months have different days. Being 1 month old could mean 28, 30, or 31 days passed depending on
                if you were born in Feb, April, or Jan.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. What if I enter a future date?</h4>
            <p>The calculator will technically show results, but usually negative values or errors. It is designed for
                past dates.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. How do I calculate "Age Next Birthday"?</h4>
            <p>Simply take your current age in years, add 1, and the "months/days" field shows how far you are from that
                integer.</p>
