    <h2 id="what-is-fd">What is a Fixed Deposit?</h2>
    <p>
        A Fixed Deposit (FD) is a financial instrument offered by banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)
        where you deposit a lump sum amount for a fixed tenure—ranging from as short as 7 days to as long as 10 years.
        In exchange for locking your money with the bank, they offer you a rate of interest that is significantly higher
        than a standard savings account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Think of it as a contract: You promise not to touch the money for X years, and the bank promises to pay you Y%
        interest. This certainty is why FDs are categorized as "Fixed Income" assets. Regardless of whether the economy
        booms or goes into a recession, your FD return stays exactly what was promised on day one.
    </p>

    <h2 id="how-it-works">How FD Interest Calculation Works (The Math)</h2>
    <p>
        Most people assume that if the interest rate is 6% per annum, they get 6% at the end of the year. That is
        <em>Simple Interest</em>. But FDs use the magic of <strong>Compound Interest</strong>.
        <br><br>
        In India, most banks follow <strong>Quarterly Compounding</strong>. This means the bank calculates interest
        every 3 months (Quarter) and adds it back to your principal.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <br>You invest ₹1,00,000 at 8% p.a.
        <br><strong>Quarter 1 (Months 1-3):</strong> Interest is calculated on ₹1,00,000. Interest = ₹2,000. New Balance
        = ₹1,02,000.
        <br><strong>Quarter 2 (Months 4-6):</strong> Interest is calculated on ₹1,02,000 (not just the original 1 Lakh).
        Interest = ₹2,040.
        <br><br>
        This "Interest on Interest" creates a snowball effect. Over 10 years, this difference becomes massive. That is
        why the "Annualized Yield" of an FD is always higher than the raw "Interest Rate". Our calculator accounts for
        this precise quarterly compounding to give you the exact maturity value down to the last rupee.
    </p>

    <h2 id="types">Types of Fixed Deposits</h2>
    <p>Not all FDs are created equal. Choosing the right type depends on your financial goal.</p>

    <h3>1. Cumulative FD (Growth Option)</h3>
    <p>
        In this type, interest is NOT paid to you during the tenure. Instead, it is reinvested (compounded). You get the
        Principal + Accumulated Interest only at maturity.
        <br><strong>Best For:</strong> Professionals and young earners who don't need regular income and want to build
        wealth for future goals like a wedding or house purchase.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Non-Cumulative FD (Income Option)</h3>
    <p>
        Here, the interest is paid out to your savings account at regular intervals—Monthly, Quarterly, Half-yearly, or
        Yearly. There is no compounding benefit here.
        <br><strong>Best For:</strong> Retirees needing a monthly pension, or anyone needing cash flow to pay bills.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Tax-Saver FD (Section 80C)</h3>
    <p>
        A special FD with a mandatory lock-in period of <strong>5 years</strong>. The amount you invest (up to ₹1.5
        Lakhs) can be deducted from your taxable income under Section 80C.
        <br><strong>Catch:</strong> You strictly cannot withdraw this money before 5 years. Even the bank cannot allow
        it.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Flexi or Sweep-in FD</h3>
    <p>
        This links your Savings Account to an FD. If your savings balance crosses a limit (say ₹25,000), the excess is
        automatically moved to an FD to earn higher interest. If you write a cheque and need money, the FD is legally
        broken in units to honor the payment.
        <br><strong>Best For:</strong> Business owners with fluctuating cash flows.
    </p>

    <h2 id="benefits">The 7 Pillars of FD Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Guaranteed Returns:</strong> It is immune to market volatility. Sensex can fall 2000 points, but
            your FD won't lose a single paisa.</li>
        <li><strong>Capital Safety:</strong> In India, bank deposits are insured up to ₹5 Lakhs (Interest + Principal)
            by the DICGC (a subsidiary of RBI). This makes it practically risk-free.</li>
        <li><strong> liquidity:</strong> Unlike Real Estate or PPF, you can break an FD instantly (usually via
            NetBanking) in case of an emergency, albeit with a small penalty.</li>
        <li><strong>Loan Against FD:</strong> Need money but don't want to break the FD? You can take an Overdraft (OD)
            of up to 90% of the FD value. You continue earning interest on the FD, and pay only ~1-2% extra on the loan.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Senior Citizen Benefit:</strong> Banks offer an additional 0.50% to 0.75% interest to citizens above
            60 years.</li>
        <li><strong>Credit Card Eligibility:</strong> No credit history? You can get a "Secured Credit Card" backing it
            with an FD. This helps students leverage credit.</li>
        <li><strong>Habit of Saving:</strong> It locks your money away from impulsive spending.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="laddering">FD Laddering: The Secret Strategy</h2>
    <p>
        The biggest problem with FD is the "Reinvestment Risk". What if you lock money for 5 years at 5%, and next year
        the rates jump to 8%? You lose out. Or what if you lock for 1 year, and rates fall next year?
        <br><br>
        <strong>The Solution: FD Laddering.</strong>
        <br>Instead of investing ₹5 Lakhs in one FD for 5 years, split it into 5 FDs of ₹1 Lakh each for 1, 2, 3, 4, and
        5 years.
        <br>- After Year 1, FD #1 matures. Reinvest it for 5 years.
        <br>- After Year 2, FD #2 matures. Reinvest it for 5 years.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Result:</strong> Every year, one FD matures, giving you liquidity. And you capture the "Average High"
        interest rates over a long cycle. You create a perpetual loop of maturing money.
    </p>

    <h2 id="taxation">The Truth About FD Taxation</h2>
    <p>
        A common myth is that because tax is deducted at source (TDS), you don't need to pay more tax. This is FALSE.
        <br><strong>1. TDS:</strong> Banks deduct 10% TDS if interest exceeds ₹40,000/year (₹50k for Seniors). If you
        don't provide PAN, they deduct 20%.
        <br><strong>2. Your Slab:</strong> The interest income is added to your total annual income. If you fall in the
        30% tax slab, you have to pay the remaining 20% tax (30% slab - 10% TDS) while filing your ITR.
        <br><strong>3. Form 15G/15H:</strong> If your total income is below the taxable limit, you can submit these
        forms to the bank to stop them from cutting TDS.

    <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Can I lose money in an FD?</h4>
            <p>Only if the bank collapses. However, RBI regulations are extremely strict, and DICGC insures deposits up
                to ₹5 Lakhs. Stick to large Scheduled Commercial Banks for 100% safety.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. What is the penalty for premature withdrawal?</h4>
            <p>Usually 0.5% to 1%. Also, the interest paid will be for the <em>actual</em> duration the money stayed
                with the bank, minus the penalty. It can significantly reduce returns.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. Corporate FD vs Bank FD?</h4>
            <p>Corporate FDs (by companies like Bajaj Finance, Shriram, etc.) offer 1-2% higher rates but are riskier.
                They are not insured by DICGC. Always check the credit rating (AAA is safest) before investing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. How often does the interest rate change?</h4>
            <p>Banks revise rates based on RBI's Repo Rate. Once you lock an FD, your rate is fixed for the tenure. Rate
                changes only apply to <em>new</em> FDs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Can I add money to an existing FD?</h4>
            <p>No. An FD is a one-time deposit. If you want to add money, you have to open a fresh FD. If you want to
                deposit monthly, open a Recurring Deposit (RD).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Is FD interest taxable for Senior Citizens?</h4>
            <p>Yes, but they get a special deduction under <strong>Section 80TTB</strong>, allowing tax-free interest
                income up to ₹50,000 per year.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. What is the minimum and maximum tenure?</h4>
            <p>Minimum is usually 7 days. Maximum is usually 10 years. For periods longer than 10 years, you have to
                renew the FD at maturity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. Nomination facility?</h4>
            <p>Yes, always add a nominee. It ensures your family gets the money hassle-free in case of your unfortunate
                demise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. Can I transfer FD from one branch to another?</h4>
            <p>Yes, most banks allow you to transfer your FD account to another branch if you relocate, without breaking
                the FD.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. What is better: FD or Debt Mutual Fund?</h4>
            <p>FD offers guaranteed returns and safety. Debt Funds offer potentially higher returns and better tax
                efficiency (if held >3 years with indexation, though rules changed recently). For pure safety, FD wins.
