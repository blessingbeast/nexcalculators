    <h1>Body Fat Calculator: The True Measure of Fitness</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        Throw away your weighing scale. It is lying to you. A scale tells you how much gravity pulls on you, but it
        doesn't tell you <em>what</em> you are made of. You can lose weight by dehydrating yourself (water loss) or
        starving (muscle loss), which makes you unhealthier. The true metric of health and aesthetics is <strong>Body
            Fat Percentage (BF%)</strong>. This calculator uses the US Navy Method—a surprisingly accurate formula using
        tape measurements—to estimate your composition without expensive hospital scans.

    <h2 id="why-bf">Why Body Fat Matters More Than Weight</h2>
    <p>
        Two men can stand 6 feet tall and weigh 100 kg.
        <br><strong>Man A:</strong> Couch potato. 35% Body Fat. High risk of diabetes.
        <br><strong>Man B:</strong> Bodybuilder. 10% Body Fat. Peak health.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Types of Fat:</strong>
        <br><strong>1. Subcutaneous Fat:</strong> The jiggly fat under your skin. Annoying but less harmful.
        <br><strong>2. Visceral Fat:</strong> The hard fat around your organs (Beer belly). This releases inflammatory
        cytokines and kills you.
        <br>Our calculator estimates total body fat, helping you minimize the visceral risks.

    <h3>Men</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Essential Fat (2-5%):</strong> Survival level. Bodybuilders on stage. Unhealthy long term.</li>
        <li><strong>Athletic (6-13%):</strong> Visible 6-pack abs. Vascularity.</li>
        <li><strong>Fitness (14-17%):</strong> Outline of abs. Athletic build.</li>
        <li><strong>Average (18-24%):</strong> No definition. Soft look. "Dad Bod".</li>
        <li><strong>Obese (25%+):</strong> Significant belly fat. Health risks begin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Women</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Essential Fat (10-13%):</strong> Required for periods/hormones. Any lower causes amenorrhea.</li>
        <li><strong>Athletic (14-20%):</strong> Firm, toned, some muscle separation.</li>
        <li><strong>Fitness (21-24%):</strong> Curves but lean.</li>
        <li><strong>Average (25-31%):</strong> Soft curves.</li>
        <li><strong>Obese (32%+):</strong> Excess weight.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="navy">The US Navy Method Explained</h2>
    <p>
        The US Navy needed a cheap, fast way to measure fitness for thousands of sailors. They developed a formula based
        on circumferences:
        <br><strong>Men:</strong> Neck and Waist (at navel).
        <br><strong>Women:</strong> Neck, Waist (narrowest), and Hips (widest).
        <br><br>
        <strong>The Logic:</strong>
        <br>- Fat accumulates on the waist/hips.
        <br>- It rarely accumulates on the neck (unless very obese).
        <br>- By comparing the "fat site" (Waist) to the "lean site" (Neck/Height), the formula predicts density. It is
        accurate within 3-4% of Hydrostatic Weighing.
    </p>

    <h2 id="how-to-lower">How to Lower Body Fat</h2>
    <p>
        Lowering BF% is different from "Losing Weight".
        <br><strong>Goal:</strong> Lose Fat, Keep Muscle.
        <br>1. <strong>High Protein:</strong> 2g per kg bodyweight. Protects muscle in a deficit.
        <br>2. <strong>Resistance Training:</strong> Tells body "I need this muscle".
        <br>3. <strong>Moderate Deficit:</strong> Los slowly (0.5% weight per week). Fast loss usually burns muscle.
        <br>4. <strong>Sleep:</strong> Lack of sleep eats muscle.

    <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Can I spot reduce belly fat?</h4>
            <p>100% Myth. You cannot choose where fat comes off. Doing crunches builds abs <em>under</em> the fat, but
                doesn't burn the fat on top. You must lose overall body fat.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. Smart Scales vs Tape Measure?</h4>
            <p>Tape (Navy Method) is surprisingly more consistent. Smart scales fluctuate wildly with hydration (drink
                water -> BF% changes 2%). Tape doesn't lie.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. Skinny Fat solution?</h4>
            <p>Don't just diet. You need to <strong>Recomp</strong>. Eat at maintenance calories and lift heavy. Convert
                fat to fuel for muscle growth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. How accurate is this?</h4>
            <p>It's an estimate. If it says 15%, you might be 13% or 17%. But it's perfect for tracking <em>trends</em>
                over months.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Why do women need more fat?</h4>
            <p>Evolution. Fat stores energy for potential pregnancy and breastfeeding. Hormones like estrogen encourage
                fat storage in hips/thighs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Whoosh Effect?</h4>
            <p>Fat cells fill with water as they empty triglycerides. You feel squishy. Suddenly, the water drops and
                you look leaner overnight.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. Best exercise for fat loss?</h4>
            <p>Compound lifts (Squats, Deadlifts) burn most energy. Walking (LISS) burns pure fat but slowly. HIIT burns
                fast but taxes recovery.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. What is DEXA?</h4>
            <p>Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry. The Gold Standard medical scan. Costs money but tells you exactly where
                fat is.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. Does muscle turn into fat?</h4>
            <p>No. Different tissues. Muscle atrophy (shrinks) and fat cells hypertrophy (expand) if you stop training
                and eat bad.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. How often to measure?</h4>
            <p>Once every 2 weeks. Body composition changes slowly.</p>
