    <h1>BMR Calculator: Discover Your Metabolic Speed</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        Imagine your body is a car. Even when the car is parked in the driveway with the engine idling, it consumes
        fuel. That idling fuel consumption is your <strong>BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)</strong>. It is the minimum energy
        required to keep your heart beating, lungs breathing, and brain firing. Understanding your BMR is the very first
        step in designing a nutrition plan, because eating below this number is often dangerous.

    <h2 id="what-is-bmr">BMR vs RMR: What's the Difference?</h2>
    <p>
        You will often hear these terms used interchangeably, but there is a nuance:
        <br><strong>BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate):</strong> Strictly measured in a darkened room upon waking after 12 hours
        of fasting. Pure survival mode.
        <br><strong>RMR (Resting Metabolic Rate):</strong> Measured under less strict conditions (e.g., sitting on a
        chair). Includes light movements and digestion.
        <br>RMR is usually 10% higher than BMR. Our calculator provides BMR, which is the standard baseline for diet
        planning.
    </p>

    <h2 id="variables">Variables That Influence BMR</h2>
    <p>Why does your friend eat twice as much as you and not gain weight? BMR Differences.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Muscle Mass (The Biggest Factor):</strong> Muscle is metabolically expensive. 1kg of muscle burns
            ~13 kcal/day at rest. 1kg of fat burns only ~4 kcal. A muscular person has a furnace BMR.</li>
        <li><strong>Body Size:</strong> Larger surface area = more heat loss = higher BMR. Tall people burn more.</li>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> BMR drops by 2-3% per decade after age 20 due to muscle loss (Sarcopenia).</li>
        <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Men generally have 5-10% higher BMR due to higher testosterone and muscle mass.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Accounts for about 10-15% variance. Not as much as people blame it!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="formulas">The Math (Mifflin-St Jeor)</h2>
    <p>
        For decades, the Harris-Benedict equation was king. But in 1990, the Mifflin-St Jeor equation replaced it as the
        most accurate standard.
        <br><strong>Men:</strong> (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5
        <br><strong>Women:</strong> (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161
        <br>It is accurate to within 10% for most non-obese individuals.
    </p>

    <h2 id="metabolism">Can You "Boost" Your Metabolism?</h2>
    <p>
        The supplement industry sells "Fat Burners" that claim to boost metabolism. Most differ by < 1%. <br>
            <strong>Real ways to boost BMR:</strong>
            <br>1. <strong>Lift Heavy Weights:</strong> Building 5kg of muscle adds ~50-100 kcal to your BMR
            permanently. The "Afterburn effect" (EPOC) from lifting keeps BMR elevated for 24 hours.
            <br>2. <strong>Eat Protein:</strong> High TEF boosts metabolism temporarily.
            <br>3. <strong>NEAT:</strong> Stand more. Walk more. It's not BMR, but it acts like a metabolic boost.
    </p>

    <h2 id="dieting">The Dangers of Crash Dieting</h2>
    <p>
        If your BMR is 1500 and you go on a 1000 calorie diet:
        <br>1. Your body senses famine.
        <br>2. It lowers thyroid function.
        <br>3. It shuts down "luxuries" like hair growth, libido, and warmth (you feel cold).
        <br>4. Your BMR drops to 1000 to match intake.
        <br>5. You stop losing weight.
        <br>6. You give up and eat 2000 calories.
        <br>7. Since your BMR is now 1000, you gain weight RAPIDLY. (The Yo-Yo Effect).
        <br><strong>Rule:</strong> Never eat below your BMR for long periods.

    <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Does drinking ice water boost BMR?</h4>
            <p>Technically yes, your body burns energy to heat the water to 37°C. But it burns maybe 8 calories per
                glass. Negligible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. Does spicy food help?</h4>
            <p>Capsaicin in peppers can raise BMR by 1-2% for a short time. Helpful, but won't fix a bad diet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. Why does BMR drop with age?</h4>
            <p>Mainly because we move less and lose muscle. If you stay active and lift weights, your BMR stays high
                even at 60.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. Hypothyroidism?</h4>
            <p>An under-active thyroid can lower BMR by 200-500 calories. Medication usually restores it to normal
                levels.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. BMR measuring devices?</h4>
            <p>Smart scales use Bio-impedance. They are okay for trends but not meant for medical accuracy. A metabolic
                ward Gas Analysis is the only 100% accurate way.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Sleep and BMR?</h4>
            <p>Sleep deprivation lowers BMR slightly but mainly increases Hunger hormones (Ghrelin), making you eat
                more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. Can I ruin my metabolism permanently?</h4>
            <p>Rarely. Studies on "Biggest Loser" contestants showed prolonged slowing, but for most people, "Reverse
                Dieting" restores BMR in a few months.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. BMR for kids?</h4>
            <p>Children have huge BMRs relative to size because growing requires massive energy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. Does Caffeine work?</h4>
            <p>Yes, caffeine is a proven thermogenic. It can boost BMR by 3-11%, but tolerance builds up quickly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. How to use BMR for weight gain?</h4>
            <p>Eat BMR + Activity + 500 kcal. If scale doesn't move, add 200 more.</p>
