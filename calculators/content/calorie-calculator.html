    <h1>Calorie Calculator: The Science of Weight Management</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        In the fitness world, there is a saying: "You can't out-train a bad diet." No matter how much you run or lift,
        if you don't control the energy entering your body, you cannot control your weight. But how much energy do you
        need? 2000 calories? 1500? 3000? The answer is unique to your biology. This calculator determines your
        <strong>TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)</strong>—the precise number of calories you burn every 24 hours.
        It is the most important number for your fitness journey.

    <h2 id="energy-balance">The Law of Energy Balance</h2>
    <p>
        Your body is a machine. Food is fuel.
        <br><strong>Energy In = Energy Out:</strong> Weight stays the same (Maintenance).
        <br><strong>Energy In > Energy Out:</strong> Excess energy is stored as FAT (Weight Gain).
        <br><strong>Energy In < Energy Out:</strong> Stored energy (Fat) is burned (Weight Loss).
                <br><br>
                It is that simple. Hormones, insulin, and genetics play a role, but they cannot break the laws of
                physics.
    </p>

    <h2 id="components">The 4 Components of Metabolism</h2>
    <p>Where do your calories go? TDEE is made of four parts:</p>

    <h3>1. BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) - 60-70%</h3>
    <p>Energy used in a coma. Brain function, pumping blood, growing hair, repairing cells. Even if you sleep 24 hours,
        you burn massive calories.</p>

    <h3>2. NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) - 15-20%</h3>
    <p>Walking to the fridge, fidgeting, typing, standing, cleaning. This is the "hidden" calorie burner. People with
        active jobs (waiters, nurses) have huge NEAT compared to desk workers.</p>

    <h3>3. TEF (Thermic Effect of Food) - 10%</h3>
    <p>Energy used to digest food.
        <br>Protein: High TEF (20-30% calories burned digesting it).
        <br>Carbs: Moderate TEF (5-10%).
        <br>Fats: Low TEF (0-3%).
        <br><em>Tip: Eat more protein to burn more calories automatically.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>4. EAT (Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) - 5-10%</h3>
    <p>The gym sessions, running, sports. Surprisingly, this is the SMALLEST part. A 30 min run burns only 300 kcal
        (equal to 1 snickers bar). This is why "burning off" a bad diet is impossible.</p>

    <h2 id="goals">How to Adjust for Goals</h2>

    <h3>To Lose Fat (The Cut)</h3>
    <p>Subtract 300-500 calories from your TDEE. This creates a deficit of ~3500 calories per week, which equals roughly
        1 lb (0.45 kg) of fat loss per week.
        <br><em>Warning:</em> Don't go 1000 calories below. You will crash your hormones (Testosterone/Thyroid) and lose
        muscle.
    </p>

    <h3>To Build Muscle (The Bulk)</h3>
    <p>Add 200-300 calories above TDEE. You need excess energy to build new tissue.
        <br><em>Warning:</em> "Dirty Bulking" (eating everything) just makes you fat. Aim for a "Lean Bulk".
    </p>

    <h2 id="macros">Counting Macros vs Calories</h2>
    <p>
        Calories control weight. Macros (Protein, Carbs, Fats) control body composition.
        <br>If you eat 1500 calories of pure sugar, you will lose weight (if it's a deficit), but you will look "skinny
        fat" and feel terrible.
        <br>If you eat 1500 calories with high protein (2g per kg bodyweight) and veggies, you will lose fat and keep
        muscle.

    <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Are all calories equal?</h4>
            <p>Thermodynamically yes, biologically no. 100kcal of Broccoli affects hormones/fullness differently than
                100kcal of Coke.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. How often should I recalculate TDEE?</h4>
            <p>Every 5 kgs of weight change. As you get lighter, you burn fewer calories, so you need to lower intake.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. What about "Starvation Mode"?</h4>
            <p>It's mostly a myth. Metabolic adaptation happens (BMR slows down slightly), but you won't stop losing
                weight if you are truly in a deficit.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. Should I eat back gym calories?</h4>
            <p>No. Fitness trackers overestimate burns by 20-30%. Treat gym burns as "bonus" weight loss. Don't eat them
                back.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Can I lose fat and build muscle?</h4>
            <p>Yes, "Body Recomposition" is possible for beginners or those returning after a break. Eat at Maintenance
                calories with High Protein.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Best activity level setting?</h4>
            <p>Be conservative. Most people are "Sedentary" even if they gym 3x a week. Start low, if weight drops too
                fast, eat more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. Cheat Meals vs Cheat Days?</h4>
            <p>Cheat Meal is better. A full Cheat Day (4000+ kcal) can wipe out the entire week's deficit of 3500 kcal.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. Alcohol calories?</h4>
            <p>Values at 7 kcal/gram (more than carbs/protein!). Plus it stops fat burning until alcohol is cleared from
                blood.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. Intermittent Fasting?</h4>
            <p>It's just a tool to restrict feeding window. It works because you generally eat less. No magic metabolic
                advantage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. How fast can I lose?</h4>
            <p>Safe rate is 0.5% to 1% of body weight per week. Faster = Muscle Loss.</p>
