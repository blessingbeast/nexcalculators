    <h1>Ovulation Calculator: Maximizing Conception Chances</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        For couples trying to conceive, timing is not just important—it is everything. Contrary to popular belief, a
        woman cannot get pregnant on any day of the month. There is a precise biological window of opportunity, lasting
        roughly 6 days, called the "Fertile Window". The <strong>Ovulation Calculator</strong> identifies this peak
        fertility period, taking the guesswork out of baby-making (or helping you avoid it if using the Rhythm Method).

    <h2 id="science">The Science of Ovulation</h2>
    <p>
        Ovulation is the event where a mature egg is released from the ovary and travels down the fallopian tube.
        <br><strong>Timing:</strong> It usually happens 14 days <em>before</em> the next period starts.
        <br>- 28 Day Cycle: Day 14.
        <br>- 30 Day Cycle: Day 16.
        <br>- 21 Day Cycle: Day 7.
        <br>Once released, the egg survives for only 12-24 hours. If it isn't fertilized by sperm in that time, it
        disintegrates, and menstruation follows 2 weeks later.
    </p>

    <h2 id="window">The Fertile Window Explained</h2>
    <p>
        If the egg only lasts 24 hours, why is the fertile window 6 days?
        <br>Because <strong>Sperm is resilient.</strong>
        <br>Sperm can survive inside the female reproductive tract for up to 5 days.
        <br><br>
        <strong>The Scenario:</strong> You have sex on Tuesday. You ovulate on Friday. The sperm from Tuesday is still
        waiting in the fallopian tube to ambush the egg on Friday.
        <br><strong>Peak Fertility:</strong> The 2 days before ovulation and the day of ovulation.
    </p>

    <h2 id="signs">Physical Signs of Ovulation</h2>
    <p>
        Calculators are math. Your body confirms biology. Look for these signs:
        <br><strong>1. Basal Body Temperature (BBT):</strong> Your resting temp spikes slightly (0.5°F) <em>after</em>
        ovulation. Tracking this confirms you ovulated.
        <br><strong>2. Cervical Mucus:</strong> Approaches "Egg White" consistency—clear, stretchy, and slippery. This
        helps sperm swim.
        <br><strong>3. Mittelschmerz:</strong> Some women feel a mild twinge or pain on one side of the lower abdomen
        when the egg releases.
        <br><strong>4. Libido:</strong> Nature increases sex drive during this window.
    </p>

    <h2 id="irregular">Dealing with Irregular Cycles</h2>
    <p>
        If your period comes every 25 days one month and 40 days the next, a calculator is only a rough guess.
        <br><strong>Solution:</strong> Use Ovulation Prediction Kits (OPKs). These are urine strips (like pregnancy
        tests) that detect the LH Surge—a hormon spike that happens 24-36 hours before ovulation.
    </p>

    <h2 id="gender">Boy or Girl? (Shettles Method)</h2>
    <p>
        Dr. Landrum Shettles theorized that:
        <br><strong>Y-Sperm (Boy):</strong> Fast swimmers but die young. (Prefer sex close to ovulation).
        <br><strong>X-Sperm (Girl):</strong> Slow swimmers but tough/long-lasting. (Prefer sex 2-3 days before
        ovulation).
        <br><em>Note: This is controversial and not 100% scientifically proven, but fun to try!</em>

    <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Can I get pregnant on my period?</h4>
            <p>Unlikely, but possible if you have a very short cycle (e.g., 21 days) and ovulate immediately after
                bleeding stops, as sperm can survive 5 days from period sex.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. Anovulatory Cycle?</h4>
            <p>Yes, sometimes you have a period without releasing an egg. Common in PCOS or high stress.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. How often should we have sex?</h4>
            <p>Every other day during the fertile window is optimal. Daily sex is fine too but might lower sperm count
                slightly (though usually not enough to matter).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. Does position matter?</h4>
            <p>No scientific evidence suggests any position is better for conception. Gravity doesn't play a huge role;
                sperm are strong swimmers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Lubricants?</h4>
            <p>Avoid standard lubes; they can kill sperm. Use "fertility-friendly" lubricants or none at all.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Age factor?</h4>
            <p>Fertility declines sharply after 35. The window doesn't change, but egg quality does.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. Can I confirm ovulation at home?</h4>
            <p>Progesterone blood tests (Day 21) are the only confirmation. OPKs predicts it, BBT confirms it happened.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. Implantation bleeding?</h4>
            <p>Light spotting 6-12 days after conception. Often mistaken for a light period.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. The Pill?</h4>
            <p>Hormonal birth control works by stopping ovulation. You cannot use this calculator if you are on the
                pill.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. Stress?</h4>
            <p>High cortisol (stress hormone) can delay ovulation. "Just relax" is annoying advice, but scientifically
                grounded.</p>
