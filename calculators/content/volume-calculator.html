    <h1>Volume Calculator: Measuring the 3D World</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        We live in a three-dimensional world, and <strong>Volume</strong> is how we measure the capacity of that world.
        Whether you are shipping a package, filling a swimming pool, or pouring concrete for a foundation, knowing the
        volume is essential to avoid waste and manage costs. This calculator computes the volume for Cubes (boxes,
        rooms) and Spheres (balls, tanks).

    <h2 id="definition">What is Volume?</h2>
    <p>
        Volume is the amount of 3-dimensional space occupied by an object.
        <br>If Area is "How much paint to cover it", Volume is "How much water to fill it".
        <br><strong>Units:</strong> Always cubed. Meter³ (m³), Centimeter³ (cc), Feet³.
        <br><strong>Liquid Measure:</strong> Liters, Gallons. (1 m³ = 1000 Liters).
    </p>

    <h2 id="cube">The Cube: Packaging & Storage</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Formula:</strong> Side × Side × Side (S³)
        <br>For a rectangular box (Cuboid): Length × Width × Height.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Logistics:</strong>
        <br>Shipping companies charge by "Volumetric Weight". If you ship a large box of feathers, it's light but takes
        up space. Airlines calculate: (L x W x H) / 5000. If this Volumetric Weight > Actual Weight, you pay for the
        Volume.
        <br>This is why you should never ship air! Pack tightly.
    </p>

    <h2 id="sphere">The Sphere: Efficiency in Nature</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Formula:</strong> (4/3) × π × r³
        <br>The sphere is the most efficient shape in the universe. It encloses the maximum volume with the minimum
        surface area.
        <br>- Why are bubbles round? To minimize surface tension (area).
        <br>- Why are planets round? Gravity pulls everything equally to the center.
        <br>- Why are LPG tanks capsules/spheres? To distribute pressure evenly. Corners create weak points where tanks
        can explode.
    </p>

    <h2 id="archimedes">The Story of Eureka (Displacement)</h2>
    <p>
        How do you measure the volume of a crown or a rock? You can't use a ruler.
        <br>Archimedes found the solution in his bathtub.
        <br><strong>Principle:</strong> The volume of water displaced by a submerged object is equal to the volume of
        the object.
        <br>This method allows us to measure irregular shapes accurately.

    <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Gallon vs Liter?</h4>
            <p>1 US Gallon = 3.785 Liters. 1 UK Gallon = 4.546 Liters. Always check which "Gallon" is being used.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. What is "cc" in engines?</h4>
            <p>Cubic Centimeters. A 2000cc engine has a total cylinder volume of 2 Liters. More volume = More fuel/air =
                More power.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. Volume of a Cylinder?</h4>
            <p>π × r² × h. Essential for calculating water tank capacity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. Mass vs Volume?</h4>
            <p>They are linked by Density. Mass = Volume × Density. 1 Liter of water weighs 1 kg. 1 Liter of Mercury
                weighs 13.5 kg!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Barrel of Oil?</h4>
            <p>Standard unit in petroleum. 1 Barrel = 159 Liters (42 US Gallons).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Capacity vs Volume?</h4>
            <p>Technically, Volume is space <em>occupied</em> (outside dimensions). Capacity is space <em>contained</em>
                (internal dimensions). Wall thickness makes the difference.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. How to estimate pool volume?</h4>
            <p>Avg Length × Avg Width × Avg Depth. If depth slopes, take the average of shoolow and deep ends.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. Cooking measurements?</h4>
            <p>1 Teaspoon = 5ml. 1 Tablespoon = 15ml. 1 Cup = 240ml (US) or 250ml (Metric).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. Does temperature affect volume?</h4>
            <p>Yes! Thermal Expansion. Bridges expand in summer. Liquids expand significantly (don't fill gas tanks to
                the brim in hot weather).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. Volume of a pyramid?</h4>
            <p>(Base Area × Height) / 3. It applies to cones too.</p>
