    <h1>Simple Interest Calculator: The Foundation of Finance</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        Before spreadsheets and complex algorithms, the financial world ran on <strong>Simple Interest</strong>. Even
        today, despite the dominance of compound interest in wealth creation, simple interest remains a vital concept in
        short-term lending, consumer finance, and informal debt agreements. It is the easiest way to understand the cost
        of borrowing money: you pay a fee based strictly on what you borrowed and how long you kept it. This calculator
        cuts through the noise to give you that precise figure.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Simple Interest?</h2>
    <p>
        Simple Interest (SI) is a method of calculating interest where the interest charge is always based on the
        <strong>Original Principal</strong> amount.
        <br>Unlike Compound Interest, where interest is added to the principal to form a new base, Simple Interest
        ignores previously earned interest. The principal remains constant throughout the loan term.

    <h2>The Formula</h2>
    <div class="formula-box"
        style="background: #eafaf1; padding: 20px; border-left: 5px solid var(--primary-color); margin: 20px 0;">
        <h3 style="margin-top:0;">SI = (P × R × T) / 100</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>P (Principal):</strong> The initial amount of money.</li>
            <li><strong>R (Rate):</strong> The annual interest rate percentage.</li>
            <li><strong>T (Time):</strong> The time duration in years.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Total Amount = P + SI</h3>
    </div>

    <h2>Where is Simple Interest Used?</h2>

    <h3>1. Short-Term Personal Loans</h3>
    <p>
        Loans for small durations (e.g., 6 months) often use simple interest because the compounding effect would be
        negligible anyway.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Car Loans (Flat Rate Trap)</h3>
    <p>
        This is critical. Car dealers often quote a "Flat Rate" of, say, 5%. This sounds cheap compared to a bank's 9%.
        However, Flat Rate is a fancy word for Simple Interest.
        <br>In a 5% Flat Rate loan for 5 years, you pay interest on the full loan amount even in the 5th year when
        you've already repaid most of it.
        <br><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> A 5% Flat Rate is roughly equal to a 9-10% Reducing Balance Rate. Always convert
        to compare!
    </p>

    <h3>3. Certificates of Deposit (CDs)</h3>
    <p>
        Some banks offer short-term CDs that pay simple interest upon maturity.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Discounts for Early Payment</h3>
    <p>
        Businesses often offer "2/10 Net 30" terms. (2% discount if paid in 10 days). This is effectively a simple
        interest calculation on the cash flow.
    </p>

    <h2>The "T" Factor: Time Units</h2>
    <p>
        The formula expects Time (T) in Years.
        <br>- If your Tenure is in <strong>Months</strong>: Divide by 12. (6 months = 0.5 years).
        <br>- If your Tenure is in <strong>Days</strong>: Divide by 365. (90 days = 90/365 years).
        <br>Our calculator handles these conversions automatically when you input the data.
    </p>

    <h2>Simple vs Compound: An Example</h2>
    <p>
        Invest ₹10,000 at 10% for 3 years.
        <br><strong>Simple Interest:</strong>
        <br>Year 1: ₹1,000
        <br>Year 2: ₹1,000
        <br>Year 3: ₹1,000
        <br>Total: ₹13,000.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Compound Interest:</strong>
        <br>Year 1: ₹1,000
        <br>Year 2: ₹1,100 (10% on 11k)
        <br>Year 3: ₹1,210 (10% on 12.1k)
        <br>Total: ₹13,310.
        <br>The gap widens drastically as time increases.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        While Simple Interest might seem "less profitable" for investors, it is "more expensive" for borrowers in Flat
        Rate scenarios. Master this calculation to decode marketing offers on loans and EMI schemes. If it sounds too
        good to be true (like a very low interest rate), checking if it's Simple vs Reducing interest is usually the key
        to finding the catch.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Can I use days in the formula?</h4>
            <p>Yes. Use (P × R × Days) / 36500.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. Is exact interest different from ordinary interest?</h4>
            <p>Yes. Ordinary interest assumes a 360-day year (Banker's year). Exact interest uses 365 days. The
                difference is small but real.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. How do I calculate daily interest?</h4>
            <p>Divide the annual rate by 365 to get the daily rate constant, then multiply by Principal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. Why do banks use Compound instead of Simple?</h4>
            <p>Because they lend money out to make profit (Compound helps them) and pay deposit holders to attract funds
                (Compound helps us). It aligns with the economic reality of opportunity cost.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Is simple interest good for a loan?</h4>
            <p>Only if the rate is significantly lower than the market reducing-balance rate. Usually, it is a trap.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Does Simple Interest apply to Credit Cards?</h4>
            <p>NO! Credit cards use daily compounding, which is the most aggressive form of compound interest.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. Can I negotiate simpler interest?</h4>
            <p>In informal lending (family/friends), simple interest is the standard because it avoids "profiting on
                profit" socially.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. What is a "Balloon Payment"?</h4>
            <p>A loan where you pay only simple interest monthly, and the full principal is paid as a massive lump sum
                at the very end.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. How to find the Rate if I know Interest?</h4>
            <p>R = (100 × SI) / (P × T). Algebra helps!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. Is 0% EMI real?</h4>
            <p>Usually not. The interest cost is hidden in the "Processing Fee" or by removing the cash discount on the
                product.</p>
