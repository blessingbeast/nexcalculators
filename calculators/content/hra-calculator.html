    <h1>HRA Calculator: Your Key to Tax-Free Rent</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        For millions of salaried employees in India, <strong>House Rent Allowance (HRA)</strong> is the single biggest
        tax-saving component in their payslip. Yet, every year during investment proof submission, confusion reigns.
        "Why is my full HRA not tax-free?" "Can I pay rent to my parents?" "What is a Metro city?" This <strong>HRA
            Calculator</strong> cuts through the jargon and tells you exactly how much tax exemption you can claim under
        Section 10(13A) of the Income Tax Act.

    <h2 id="rules">The Golden Formula (Section 10(13A))</h2>
    <p>
        The Income Tax Department does not blindly exempt whatever HRA your company gives you. The exemption is the
        <strong>LEAST</strong> of the following three values:
    </p>
    <div style="background: #fdf2e9; padding: 20px; border-left: 5px solid #d35400; margin: 20px 0;">
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Actual HRA Received:</strong> The amount listed in your salary slip.</li>
            <li><strong>Rent Paid - 10% of Basic Salary:</strong> The section assumes you should afford 10% of basic
                rent yourself. Exemption is only on the excess.</li>
            <li><strong>50% (or 40%) of Basic Salary:</strong> Depending on your city.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p>
        <em>Note: "Salary" here means Basic Pay + Dearness Allowance (DA). It excludes special allowances, overtime, or
            bonuses.</em>
    </p>

    <h2 id="metro">Metro vs Non-Metro Rules</h2>
    <p>
        The 3rd condition varies by city.
        <br><strong>50% of Basic:</strong> If you live in a Metro. The IT Act defines metros ONLY as:
        <br>- Delhi
        <br>- Mumbai
        <br>- Kolkata
        <br>- Chennai
        <br><br>
        <strong>40% of Basic:</strong> All other cities (including Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, Gurgaon).
        <br>This often confuses people in cities like Bangalore where rents are high, but the exemption limit is capped
        at 40%.
    </p>

    <h2 id="parents">Paying Rent to Parents / Spouse</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Parents:</strong> Yes! This is a legal tax planning strategy. If you live with your parents, you can pay
        them rent and claim HRA.
        <br><em>Condition 1:</em> You must actually transfer the money (bank trail).
        <br><em>Condition 2:</em> Your parents must declare this as "Income from House Property" in their tax returns.
        If their income is below the taxable limit, the family saves tax overall.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Spouse:</strong> No. The relationship between husband and wife is not considered a commercial
        relationship. Paying rent to a spouse usually attracts scrutiny and isclubbed under your income (Clubbing of
        Income provisions). Avoid this.
    </p>

    <h2 id="proofs">Documents Required</h2>
    <p>
        If HRA > ₹3,000/month, you need rent receipts.
        <br>If Rent Paid > ₹1,00,000/year (₹8,333/month), the Landlord's PAN is Mandatory.
        <br>If the landlord does not have a PAN, he/she must sign a declaration.
        <br>Fake receipts are easily caught by data matching in AIS (Annual Information Statement). Ensure the landlord
        knows you are declaring his PAN.
    </p>

    <h2 id="home-loan">HRA + Home Loan (Double Benefit)</h2>
    <p>
        Can you claim both HRA and Home Loan Interest Deduction (Sec 24)?
        <br><strong>Yes!</strong>
        <br>Scenario: You own a house in City A (parents live there, or it's rented out) but you work in City B and live
        on rent.
        <br>- You can claim HRA for the rent you pay in City B.
        <br>- You can <em>also</em> claim interest deduction (₹2L) for the home loan in City A.
        <br>Even in the same city, if your office is far from your owned home and you rent a place near the office, you
        can claim both (subject to genuineness).

    <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Is HRA exemption available in New Tax Regime?</h4>
            <p>No. The New Tax Regime (Section 115BAC) removes most deductions, including HRA. You get only Standard
                Deduction. Compare your tax liability before choosing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. I forgot to submit proofs to my employer. Is HRA lost?</h4>
            <p>No! You can claim it directly while filing your Income Tax Return (ITR). You don't need to upload proofs
                to the ITR portal, but keep them safe for future scrutiny.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. Does maintenance charge count?</h4>
            <p>No. HRA exemption is strictly for "House Rent". Electricity and Maintenance charges paid to society are
                not covered.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. I shared a flat with friends. How to claim?</h4>
            <p>You can claim HRA to the extent of <em>your share</em> of the rent. Ensure the rent agreement mentions
                names of all tenants or get separate receipts for your share.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Can I pay rent in cash?</h4>
            <p>Ideally no. For amounts > ₹5000, bank transfer is preferred to create a paper trail. Cash receipts are
                often viewed suspiciously by tax officers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. What if my basic salary changes mid-year?</h4>
            <p>The calculation should be done monthly to be accurate. Our calculator gives an annual estimate, but
                employer software calculates month-on-month.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. Can I claim HRA if I am self-employed?</h4>
            <p>No, HRA is for salaried people. However, self-employed people can claim rent deduction under
                <strong>Section 80GG</strong> (Limit is lower: ₹5000/month or 25% of income).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. What if landlord refuses to give PAN?</h4>
            <p>If rent > 1L/year, you cannot claim full HRA without PAN. You might lose the exemption on the excess
                amount.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. Is furniture rent covered?</h4>
            <p>No. Only the rent for the building structure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. Why is HRA 40% in Bangalore/Gurgaon?</h4>
            <p>The Income Tax Act (1961) has not updated the list of metros. It only recognizes the 4 historical metros.
                Fast-growing IT hubs are still "Non-Metro" for HRA legislation.</p>
