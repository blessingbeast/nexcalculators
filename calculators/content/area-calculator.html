    <h1>Area Calculator: Measuring the Space We Inhabit</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        We live on a finite planet, and measuring the space we occupy is one of the oldest human activities. From
        Ancient Egyptians measuring land after Nile floods to a modern architect designing a 100-story skyscraper, the
        calculation of <strong>Area</strong> is fundamental to civilization. This calculator handles the two most common
        geometric needs: Rectangular Area (walls, floors, plots) and Circular Area (pipes, pillars, crop circles).

    <h2 id="concept">Understanding Area vs Perimeter</h2>
    <p>
        Many people confuse the two.
        <br><strong>Perimeter</strong> is the distance <em>around</em> the shape. (Fencing a yard). 1-Dimensional
        (linear).
        <br><strong>Area</strong> is the space <em>inside</em> the shape. (Grass needed to cover the yard).
        2-Dimensional (squared).
        <br><br>
        Imagine a painting. The frame is the perimeter. The canvas is the area.
    </p>

    <h2 id="rectangle">The Rectangle: Floors and Walls</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Formula:</strong> Length × Width
        <br>It seems simple, but it powers the entire construction industry.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Example (Painting a Room):</strong>
        <br>Wall is 10ft high and 15ft wide.
        <br>Area = 150 sq ft.
        <br>If a paint can covers 300 sq ft, you know exactly half a can is needed.
    </p>

    <h2 id="circle">The Circle: Nature's Shape</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Formula:</strong> π × r² (Pi times Radius squared)
        <br>Pi (π) ≈ 3.14159...
        <br>Why squared? Because if you double the radius of a pizza, you don't get double the pizza. You get FOUR times
        the pizza.
        <br><br>
        <strong>The Pizza Arbitrage:</strong>
        <br>8-inch pizza area = 50 sq inches.
        <br>16-inch pizza area = 200 sq inches.
        <br>Usually, the 16-inch pizza costs only 2x the price but gives 4x the food. Knowing area helps you spot deals!
    </p>

    <h2 id="applications">Real World Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Real Estate:</strong> Price per Sq Ft is the gold standard for property value. Carpet Area vs Super
            Built-Up Area relies on these calcs.</li>
        <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Farmers calculate seed and fertilizer needs based on Acreage.</li>
        <li><strong>Fabrication:</strong> Sheet metal costs are based on area.</li>
        <li><strong>Biology:</strong> Surface Area to Volume ratio determines why cells are microscopic and why
            elephants have big ears (to increase surface area for cooling).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="units">The Jungle of Units</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Metric:</strong> Sq Meter (m²), Hectare (10,000 m²).
        <br><strong>Imperial:</strong> Sq Feet (ft²), Acre (43,560 ft²).
        <br><strong>Indian Traditional:</strong>
        <br>- Bigha (Varies by state).
        <br>- Ground (South India = 2400 sq ft).
        <br>- Guntha (Maharashtra).
        <br>Our calculator sticks to standard units, but knowing the conversion factors is crucial for land deals.

    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Surface Area vs Area?</h4>
            <p>Area is 2D. Surface Area is the total area of all faces of a 3D object (wrapping paper needed to cover a
                box).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. How to measure irregular land?</h4>
            <p>Surveyors break the irregular polygon into triangles, calculate area of each triangle, and add them up
                (Triangulation).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. What is "Carpet Area"?</h4>
            <p>The actual useable area inside the walls. Does not include balconies or wall thickness. RERA mandates
                selling by Carpet Area.</p>
