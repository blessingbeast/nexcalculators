    <h1>BMI Calculator: The Ultimate Guide to Body Mass Index</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        In a world increasingly conscious of health and fitness, the term "BMI" is thrown around constantly. Doctors
        check it, insurance companies ask for it, and fitness apps track it. But what exactly is Body Mass Index (BMI),
        and why does it matter? It is more than just a number; it is a fundamental screening tool used globally to
        categorize weight classes and estimate potential health risks. This comprehensive guide will take you through
        the science of BMI, its calculation, its limitations, and how you can use it as a starting point for your
        wellness journey.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Body Mass Index (BMI)?</h2>
    <p>
        Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify underweight,
        overweight, and obesity in adults. It was originally developed in the 19th century by the Belgian statistician
        Adolphe Quetelet and was known as the Quetelet Index.
    </p>
    <p>
        The central premise of BMI is that body weight should increase proportionally to height squared. By calculating
        this ratio, we get a standardized number that allows us to compare the body mass of a person who is 5 feet tall
        with someone who is 6 feet tall. It serves as a proxy for estimating human body fat based on weight and height.
        While it doesn't measure body fat directly, research has shown that BMI correlates moderately well with more
        direct measures of body fat obtained from skinfold thickness measurements or bioelectrical impedance.

    <h2>The Calculation Formula</h2>
    <p>
        The calculation is straightforward and relies on basic arithmetic.
    </p>
    <div class="formula-box"
        style="background: #e8f8f5; padding: 20px; border-left: 5px solid #28B463; margin: 20px 0;">
        <h3 style="margin-top:0;">BMI = Weight (kg) / [Height (m)]²</h3>
        <p>Alternatively, using Imperial units:</p>
        <p><strong>BMI = 703 × Weight (lbs) / [Height (in)]²</strong></p>
    </div>
    <p>
        <strong>Example Calculation:</strong><br>
        Let's say an individual weighs 70 kilograms and is 1.75 meters (approx 5'9") tall.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Weight = 70 kg</li>
        <li>Height = 1.75 m</li>
        <li>Height Squared = 1.75 × 1.75 = 3.0625</li>
        <li>BMI = 70 / 3.0625 = <strong>22.86</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interpreting Your BMI Score</h2>
    <p>
        The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined standard categories that apply to adult men and women
        universally.

    <h3>Health Risks Associated with High BMI</h3>
    <p>Being overweight or obese puts immense strain on the body. Excess fat tissue requires more oxygen and nutrients,
        increasing the workload on the heart. It also induces chronic inflammation. Common risks include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Type 2 Diabetes</li>
        <li>Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)</li>
        <li>Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke</li>
        <li>Sleep Apnea and breathing problems</li>
        <li>Osteoarthritis (breakdown of cartilage and bone within a joint)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Health Risks Associated with Low BMI</h3>
    <p>Conversely, being underweight is not necessarily healthy. It can indicate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Malnutrition or vitamin deficiencies</li>
        <li>Anemia</li>
        <li>Weakened immune system</li>
        <li>Fertility issues</li>
        <li>Osteoporosis (brittle bones)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitations of BMI: What It Doesn't Tell You</h2>
    <p>While useful, BMI is a blunt instrument. It does not distinguish between different types of mass.</p>

    <h3>1. Muscle vs. Fat</h3>
    <p>Muscle is much denser than fat. A professional athlete or bodybuilder may have a high weight due to muscle mass
        and result in a BMI of 30 ("Obese"), despite having very low body fat and being in excellent health. In these
        cases, BMI provides a "False Positive" for obesity.</p>

    <h3>2. "Skinny Fat"</h3>
    <p>Some people have a normal weight (and thus Normal BMI) but have very little muscle and a high percentage of body
        fat. They carry their fat viscerally (around organs). These individuals may have the same metabolic risks as an
        obese person despite a "healthy" BMI score.</p>

    <h3>3. Age Factors</h3>
    <p>As we age, we naturally lose muscle mass. An elderly person might have a "Normal" BMI but could be carrying
        excess fat masked by muscle loss (sarcopenia).</p>

    <h3>4. Ethnic Differences</h3>
    <p>Studies suggest that Asian populations have higher health risks at lower BMI thresholds compared to Caucasians.
        For example, the risk for diabetes in South Asians increases at BMI > 23, not 25.</p>

    <h2>Beyond BMI: Other Metrics to Track</h2>
    <p>To get a true picture of health, use BMI alongside:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Waist Circumference:</strong> Measuring belly fat is often a better predictor of heart disease risk.
            Men > 40 inches and Women > 35 inches are at higher risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Waist-to-Hip Ratio:</strong> A ratio > 0.9 for men or > 0.85 for women indicates abdominal obesity.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Body Fat Percentage:</strong> Measured via calipers or smart scales.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>BMI Calculator</strong> is an excellent starting point. It’s quick, free, and non-invasive. If your
        number falls outside the "Normal" range, don't panic, but don't ignore it either. Use it as a prompt to evaluate
        your lifestyle—your diet, your activity levels, and your stress. Combine this data with regular blood checkups
        and professional medical advice to build a roadmap for a healthier, longer life.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Can BMI calculate body fat percentage?</h4>
            <p>No, BMI calculates body density based on weight/height. It correlates with body fat but does not measure
                it directly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. Is BMI valid for pregnant women?</h4>
            <p>No. Pregnancy contributes significant weight (baby, placenta, fluid) that distorts the calculation.
                Doctors use different charts for pregnancy weight gain.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. How accurate is BMI for children?</h4>
            <p>For children and teens (2-19 years), the math is the same, but the result is interpreted differently
                using "Percentiles" based on age and gender, because they are still growing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. How much weight do I need to lose to drop 1 BMI point?</h4>
            <p>It depends on your height. For a person of average height (5'7"), losing roughly 3-4 kg usually drops the
                BMI by 1 point.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Can I have a healthy BMI and be unhealthy?</h4>
            <p>Yes. Poor diet, smoking, and lack of exercise can lead to health issues like high cholesterol even if you
                are thin.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Why does the doctor check BMI?</h4>
            <p>It's the quickest standard risk assessment. It helps doctors decide if they need to screen you for other
                conditions like pre-diabetes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. Does bone density affect BMI?</h4>
            <p>Yes, people with larger frames or denser bones will weigh more, potentially resulting in a higher BMI,
                though the effect is usually minor compared to muscle/fat.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. What is the "New BMI" formula?</h4>
            <p>Some researchers proposed `1.3 x Weight / Height^2.5` to account for taller people naturally carrying
                more weight, but the standard WHO formula remains the global medical standard.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. Does drinking water affect BMI?</h4>
            <p>Temporarily, yes. Drinking a liter of water adds 1kg to your weight immediately, spiking your BMI
                slightly until the water is passed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. How often should I weigh myself?</h4>
            <p>For BMI tracking, once a week (same time, same clothing) is ideal to track trends without getting
                obsessed with daily fluctuations.</p>
