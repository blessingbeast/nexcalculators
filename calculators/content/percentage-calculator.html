    <h1>Percentage Calculator: Mastering the Language of Numbers</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        In our daily lives, few mathematical concepts are as ubiquitous as the percentage. From the battery indicator on
        your smartphone to the discount tag at your favorite store, from the interest rate on your savings account to
        the tax on your restaurant bill, percentages are everywhere. Yet, despite their commonality, calculating them
        quickly and accurately can often lead to confusion. This <strong>Percentage Calculator</strong> is designed to
        be your go-to tool for all things related to percentages, helping you make smarter financial, educational, and
        shopping decisions in seconds.
    </p>

    <h2>What is a Percentage?</h2>
    <p>
        The word "percentage" comes from the Latin phrase <em>per centum</em>, which literally means "by the hundred."
        In mathematics, a percentage is a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. It is denoted using the
        percent sign, "%".
    </p>
    <p>
        Think of it as a standardized way to compare quantities. If you scored 45 marks out of 50 in Math and 75 marks
        out of 100 in Science, which performance was better?
        <br>Math: (45/50) * 100 = 90%
        <br>Science: (75/100) * 100 = 75%
        <br>By converting both to a base of 100, it becomes instantly clear that the Math score was superior. This
        standardization is why percentages are the diverse language of finance, science, and statistics.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Percentage Scenarios</h2>
    <p>This calculator handles the three most common types of percentage problems you will encounter:</p>

    <h3>1. Percentage of a Value</h3>
    <p>
        <em>"What is 20% of 500?"</em><br>
        This is the most basic calculation used for tips, commissions, and simple discounts. <br>
        <strong>Formula:</strong> (Percentage / 100) * Value
    </p>

    <h3>2. Percentage Change (Increase/Decrease)</h3>
    <p>
        <em>"The price went from ₹50 to ₹60. What is the % increase?"</em><br>
        This is crucial for understanding inflation, stock market gains, or salary hikes.<br>
        <strong>Formula:</strong> ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100
    </p>

    <h3>3. Value Representation (X is what % of Y?)</h3>
    <p>
        <em>"I ate 2 slices of an 8-slice pizza. What % did I eat?"</em><br>
        Used for test scores, completing quotas, or resource usage.<br>
        <strong>Formula:</strong> (Part / Whole) * 100
    </p>

    <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>

    <h3>Shopping and Discounts</h3>
    <p>
        Retailers love percentages. "Flat 40% Off", "Buy 1 Get 1 Free" (which is 50% off), or "Additional 15% Cashback".
        Understanding how to stack these discounts ensures you know exactly how much you are saving and paying.
    </p>

    <h3>Finance and Banking</h3>
    <p>
        Interest rates are always in percentages. A 7% per annum return on a Fixed Deposit means for every ₹100 you
        invest, you get ₹7 back in a year. Conversely, a 36% APR on a credit card means you owe ₹36 for every ₹100 of
        debt annually.
    </p>

    <h3>Health and Nutrition</h3>
    <p>
        Nutrition labels list "Daily Value %". If a snack has 20% of your daily fat, eating five of them hits your
        limit. Body fat percentage is also a critical health metric, often more important than total weight.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Calculate Percentages Manually (Mental Math Tricks)</h2>
    <p>
        While our calculator is instant, knowing these mental calculations is a superpower:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Find 50%:</strong> Simply halve the number. (50% of 80 is 40).</li>
        <li><strong>Find 10%:</strong> Move the decimal point one place to the left. (10% of 250 is 25).</li>
        <li><strong>Find 1%:</strong> Move the decimal point two places to the left. (1% of 250 is 2.5).</li>
        <li><strong>Find 5%:</strong> Find 10% and then half it. (10% of 250 is 25, so 5% is 12.5).</li>
        <li><strong>Find 20%:</strong> Find 10% and double it. (10% of 250 is 25, so 20% is 50).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Percentage Points vs Percent</h2>
    <p>
        This is a common confusion in news and finance.
        <br>If a tax rate goes from 10% to 12%, it has increased by <strong>2 percentage points</strong>.
        <br>However, in terms of percentage increase, it has gone up by 20% ((12-10)/10 * 100).
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Percentages are a fundamental tool for navigating the modern world. Whether you are calculating the tip for a
        waiter, negotiating a salary raise, or analyzing the battery life of your new laptop, percentages give you the
        power of comparison. Use this <strong>Percentage Calculator</strong> to eliminate errors and get precise answers
        instantly, no matter how complex the numbers are.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Can a percentage be greater than 100?</h4>
            <p>Yes. 100% represents the whole. If you have more than the whole (e.g., your profit doubled), the
                percentage is 200%. If a price triples, it is 300% of the original price.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. How do I reverse calculate a percentage?</h4>
            <p>If you know the final price (120) includes a 20% tax, dividing by 1.20 gives the original price (100).
                Formula: Price / (1 + Tax%).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. What is the difference between % and ‰ (per mille)?</h4>
            <p>Percent (%) is per 100. Per Mille (‰) is per 1,000. Per mille is often used in oceanography (salinity) or
                demographics (birth rates).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. How do I calculate percentage change?</h4>
            <p>Subtract old value from new value. Divide that difference by the old value. Multiply by 100. Positive is
                an increase, negative is a decrease.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Is "Percent" one word or two?</h4>
            <p>"Percent" (one word) is standard in American English. "Per cent" (two words) is common in British
                English. Both mean the same thing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Does X% of Y equal Y% of X?</h4>
            <p>Yes! 8% of 25 is exactly the same as 25% of 8. (Both equal 2). This trick is very useful for mental math.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. How does percentage apply to probability?</h4>
            <p>A 0% probability means impossible. 100% means certain. 50% means a coin toss chance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. What is a "Percentile"?</h4>
            <p>A percentile indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations falls. Being in the 90th
                percentile of height means you are taller than 90% of people.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. Can I enter negative numbers?</h4>
            <p>Yes, percentages apply to negative numbers too (e.g., in coordinate geometry or finance loss
                calculations).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. What is 0% of 0?</h4>
            <p>It is 0. Mathematically, 0 divided by 100 is 0, multiplied by 0 is 0.</p>
