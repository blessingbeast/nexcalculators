    <h1>Salary Calculator: Decoding Your Paycheck</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        Congratulations on the new job offer! The offer letter says "12 Lakhs CTC". You do the mental math: 12 divided
        by 12 is 1 Lakh per month. You start planning your expenses, buying that new phone, renting a nice apartment.
        But when the first salary credit hits your bank... it's only ₹72,000. What happened? Where did the money go?
        This <strong>Salary Calculator</strong> is designed to demystify the complex world of payroll, taxes, and
        deductions, giving you a realistic picture of your "Take-Home" or "In-Hand" pay.
    </p>

    <h2>CTC vs Gross vs Net Salary</h2>
    <p>Understanding these three terms is the first step to salary negotiation.</p>

    <h3>1. CTC (Cost to Company)</h3>
    <p>This is the total amount the company spends on you. It is NOT what you get. It includes:
        <br>- Your Salary
        <br>- Company's contribution to PF
        <br>- Insurance premiums paid by company
        <br>- Gratuity provisions
        <br>- One-time joining bonuses
        <br>- Cost of laptop/cubicle (sometimes!)
    </p>

    <h3>2. Gross Salary</h3>
    <p>This is CTC minus the "non-monetary" or "deferred" components like Employer's PF and Gratuity. This is the figure
        on your salary slip before taxes.</p>

    <h3>3. Net Salary (In-Hand)</h3>
    <p>This is Gross Salary minus "Deductions". This is the actual cash that lands in your bank account.</p>

    <h2>Common Deductions Explained</h2>

    <h3>Provident Fund (EPF)</h3>
    <p>
        This is a forced savings scheme for retirement. You contribute 12% of your Basic Salary, and your employer
        matches it. While it reduces your in-hand pay today, it builds a tax-free corpus for your future.
    </p>

    <h3>Professional Tax (PT)</h3>
    <p>
        A tax levied by State Governments on salaried employees. It varies by state (Maharashtra is ₹200/month,
        Karnataka is ₹200/month) but is capped at ₹2,500 per year.
    </p>

    <h3>Income Tax (TDS)</h3>
    <p>
        Depending on your tax slab, your employer will estimate your annual tax liability and deduct 1/12th of it every
        month. This is <strong>Tax Deducted at Source</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Allowances: How to structure your Salary</h2>
    <p>
        Smart salary structuring can reduce your tax burden.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HRA (House Rent Allowance):</strong> Can be tax-exempt if you live in rent and provide receipts.
        </li>
        <li><strong>LTA (Leave Travel Allowance):</strong> Tax-free for travel within India twice in 4 years.</li>
        <li><strong>Food Coupons:</strong> Sodexo/Edenred cards used to be tax-free up to a limit.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Deduction:</strong> A flat ₹50,000 deduction is available to all employees, reducing
            taxable income.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Old Regime vs New Regime</h2>
    <p>
        Since 2020, India has two tax systems.
        <br><strong>New Regime:</strong> Lower tax rates, but you cannot claim HRA, LTA, or 80C deductions.
        <br><strong>Old Regime:</strong> Higher rates, but allows all deductions (HRA, 80C, 80D).
        <br>Your in-hand salary depends heavily on which regime you choose. Our calculator provides a general estimate,
        but detailed tax planning should be done with our specific Income Tax Calculator.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits of a Higher In-Hand Salary</h2>
    <p>
        While tax-saving is good, cash flow is king. A higher in-hand salary allows:
        <br>- Creating an Emergency Fund faster.
        <br>- Starting SIPs earlier.
        <br>- Qualifying for higher Loan EMIs.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Don't be blinded by the CTC number. A 20 Lakh CTC with a high variable component and heavy PF deduction might
        give you less monthly cash than an 18 Lakh CTC with a flat structure. Use this calculator to negotiate better.
        Ask HR for a breakdown *before* you sign.
