    <h1>Electricity Bill Calculator: Shock-Proof Your Finances</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        We rely on electricity for everything, but the monthly bill often remains a mystery. Why is the bill higher in
        summer? What happens if you run the AC for 8 hours instead of 4? This <strong>Electricity Bill
            Calculator</strong> helps you estimate your monthly power costs based on your consumption (Units) and local
        tariff rates.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding "Units" (kWh)</h2>
    <p>
        The electric meter measures in "Units".
        <br><strong>1 Unit = 1 Kilowatt-Hour (kWh).</strong>
        <br>This means using a 1000 Watt (1 kW) appliance for 1 Hour consumes 1 Unit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples:
        <br>- 2000W AC running for 1 hour = 2 Units.
        <br>- 10W LED Bulb running for 100 hours = 1 Unit.
    </p>

    <h2>Tariff Slabs</h2>
    <p>
        Electricity is charged in slabs in most places. The more you use, the higher the rate.
        <br>Example:
        <br>0-100 units: ₹3/unit.
        <br>101-200 units: ₹5/unit.
        <br>>200 units: ₹8/unit.
        <br>This "Telescopic Pricing" encourages conservation.
    </p>

    <h2>Fixed Charges</h2>
    <p>
        Apart from energy charges, bills include "Fixed Charges" based on your sanctioned load (e.g., ₹100 per kW per
        month) and various taxes (Electricity Duty).
