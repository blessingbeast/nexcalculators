    <h1>Discount Calculator: Never Miss a Deal</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        In a world of "Flash Sales", "Black Friday", and "End of Season" offers, calculating the final price of an item
        can get confusing. Is "Buy 2 Get 1 Free" better than "Flat 40% Off"? What is the final price of a ₹1999 shirt
        with a 15% discount? This <strong>Discount Calculator</strong> is your shopping companion, ensuring you know
        exactly what you pay and how much you save.
    </p>

    <h2>How Discounts Work</h2>
    <p>
        A discount is simply a reduction in the original price (List Price or MRP). It is a marketing tool used to
        increase sales volume.
        <br><strong>Formula:</strong> Savings = Original Price × (Discount % / 100).
        <br><strong>Final Price:</strong> Original Price - Savings.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Discounts</h2>

    <h3>1. Percentage Discount</h3>
    <p>The most common type. "20% Off".
        <br>Example: Price ₹100, Discount 20%. You pay ₹80.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Double Discount (Stacking)</h3>
    <p>Stores often say "50% + 20% Off". This does NOT mean 70% Off.
        <br>It means: First take 50% off (Price becomes 50). Then take 20% off the *remaining* 50 (which is 10).
        <br>Total You Pay: ₹40. Total Discount: 60%.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Buy X Get Y Free (BOGO)</h3>
    <p>"Buy 1 Get 1 Free" = 50% Off.
        <br>"Buy 2 Get 1 Free" = 33.33% Off.
        <br>Formula: (Free Items / Total Items) × 100.
    </p>

    <h2>The Psychology of Pricing</h2>
    <p>
        Retailers use specific tricks to make discounts look bigger.
        <br>- <strong>Anchoring:</strong> Showing a high "Original Price" (crossed out) to make the discounted price
        look like a steal.
        <br>- <strong>Charm Pricing:</strong> Using ₹99 instead of ₹100.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Don't let the red "Sale" tags fool you. Use this calculator to check the real math behind the offer. A deal is
        only good if the final price matches the value you get.
