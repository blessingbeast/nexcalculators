    <h1>Income Tax Calculator: Decoding the New Regime</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        Income Tax is the price we pay for civilization. But calculating it can be a headache. With the introduction of
        the <strong>New Tax Regime (default from FY 2023-24)</strong>, the calculations have changed significantly. This
        calculator focuses on the New Regime, providing a quick estimate of your liability.

    <h2>Old vs New Regime</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Old Regime:</strong> High tax rates, but allows many exemptions (HRA, 80C, 80D, Home Loan Interest).
        Good for people with heavy investments/loans.
        <br><strong>New Regime:</strong> Lower tax rates, but NO exemptions (except Standard Deduction ₹50k/₹75k). Good
        for people who want cash in hand and simpler filing.
