    <h1>Rent Affordability Calculator: Budget Your Home</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        Finding the perfect home is emotional, but paying for it is strictly financial. A common mistake is signing a
        lease for a dream apartment that slowly strangles your monthly budget. This <strong>Rent Affordability
            Calculator</strong> uses the golden rules of personal finance to tell you exactly how much rent you can
        safely afford without compromising your savings or lifestyle.
    </p>

    <h2>The 30% Rule</h2>
    <p>
        The global standard for rent affordability is the <strong>30% Rule</strong>:
        <br><em>"Do not spend more than 30% of your Gross Monthly Income on rent."</em>
        <br>If you earn ₹50,000, your rent should be max ₹15,000.
    </p>

    <h2>The 50/30/20 Rule</h2>
    <p>
        A broader budget framework:
        <br><strong>50% Needs:</strong> Rent, Groceries, Utilities.
        <br><strong>30% Wants:</strong> Dining, Travel, Hobbies.
        <br><strong>20% Savings:</strong> Investments, Emergency Fund.
        <br>Since rent is a "Need", it competes with groceries and bills. If rent is 40%, you have to cut down on food
        or savings.
    </p>

    <h2>Factors to Consider</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Commute Cost:</strong> Cheap rent far away might mean high travel costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Deposit:</strong> Usually 2-10 months of rent upfront.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Is it included in rent or extra?</li>
        <li><strong>Furnishing:</strong> Fully furnished saves money on buying furniture.</li>
    </ul>
