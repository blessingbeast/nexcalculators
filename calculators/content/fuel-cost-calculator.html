    <h1>Fuel Cost Calculator: Plan Your Trip Budget</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        With rising petrol and diesel prices, road trips require financial planning. Whether you are driving daily to
        work or planning a cross-country expedition, knowing your fuel cost is essential. This <strong>Fuel Cost
            Calculator</strong> does the math for you, considering your vehicle's mileage, the total distance, and
        current fuel prices.
    </p>

    <h2>Variables that Affect Fuel Cost</h2>

    <h3>1. Mileage (Fuel Efficiency)</h3>
    <p>
        Measured in km/l (Kilometers per Liter) or MPG (Miles Per Gallon).
        <br>A car giving 15 km/l is 50% cheaper to run than one giving 10 km/l.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Driving Style</h3>
    <p>
        Aggressive acceleration and braking can lower your mileage by 15-30%. Cruising at a constant speed is most
        efficient.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Load and AC</h3>
    <p>
        A fully loaded car with roof luggage and AC running will consume significantly more fuel.
    </p>

    <h2>Formulas</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Fuel Required (L):</strong> Distance / Mileage.
        <br><strong>Total Cost (₹):</strong> Fuel Required × Price per Liter.
    </p>

    <h2>Tips to Save Fuel</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check Tyre Pressure:</strong> Under-inflated tyres increase rolling resistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce Weight:</strong> Remove unnecessary items from the boot.</li>
        <li><strong>Engine Idling:</strong> Turn off ignition at long traffic signals (>30s).</li>
        <li><strong>Service:</strong> A clean air filter and fresh oil improve efficiency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. How to measure mileage accurately?</h4>
            <p>Tank-to-tank method. Fill full, drive X km, fill full again. Mileage = X / Liters filled.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. Highway vs City?</h4>
            <p>Highway mileage is usually 20-30% better due to less braking.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. Does AC waste fuel?</h4>
            <p>Yes, AC compressor uses engine power. Increases consumption by ~10%.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. Windows open vs AC?</h4>
            <p>At high speeds (>80kmph), windows open creates drag, which is worse than using AC.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Premium petrol?</h4>
            <p>Higher octane. Only useful for high-performance engines. No benefit for regular city cars.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Cost per km?</h4>
            <p>Total Cost / Total Distance. Useful for splitting bills.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. Electric vs Fuel?</h4>
            <p>EV running cost is ₹1/km vs Petrol ₹6-8/km.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. Cold start?</h4>
            <p>Engines are inefficient when cold. Short trips use more fuel.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. Cruise control?</h4>
            <p>Helps improve mileage on highways.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. Weight effect?</h4>
            <p>Every 50kg extra weight reduces mileage by ~2%.</p>
