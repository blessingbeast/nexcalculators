    <h1>Binary Converter: The Language of Machines</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        "There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand binary, and those who don't." Just a nerd joke?
        No, it's the fundamental reality of the digital age. Every photo you take, every message you send, and this very
        website you are reading, is boiled down to a stream of just two numbers: <strong>0 and 1</strong>. This
        <strong>Binary Calculator</strong> helps you translate between the Human language (Decimal) and the Machine
        language (Binary).

    <h2 id="why">Why 0 and 1?</h2>
    <p>
        Humans use Base-10 (Decimal) because we have 10 fingers.
        <br>Computers use Base-2 (Binary) because they run on electricity.
        <br><br>
        A transistor is a switch.
        <br><strong>Switch ON = 1 (High Voltage).</strong>
        <br><strong>Switch OFF = 0 (Low Voltage).</strong>
        <br><br>
        It is easy to build a robust circuit that detects On/Off. It is very hard to build a circuit that detects 10
        different voltage levels accurately (to represent 0-9). That's why binary won.
    </p>

    <h2 id="how">How Binary Works (Base-2)</h2>
    <p>
        In Decimal (Base-10), position values are powers of 10:
        <br>1, 10, 100, 1000...
        <br><br>
        In Binary (Base-2), position values are powers of 2:
        <br>1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128...
        <br><br>
        <strong>Example: Number 13</strong>
        <br>8 + 4 + 1 = 13.
        <br>(1x8) + (1x4) + (0x2) + (1x1)
        <br><strong>Binary: 1101</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="bytes">Bits, Bytes, and Nibbles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bit:</strong> A single 0 or 1. (Atom of data).</li>
        <li><strong>Nibble:</strong> 4 bits. (Half a byte).</li>
        <li><strong>Byte:</strong> 8 bits. (Can represent numbers 0-255).</li>
        <li><strong>Kilobyte (KB):</strong> 1024 Bytes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Why 8 bits? It was enough to represent all English characters (ASCII) originally. 'A' is 65 (01000001).
    </p>

    <h2 id="hex">Hexadecimal: The Bridge</h2>
    <p>
        Binary strings like 1011010111101 are unreadable to humans.
        <br>Decimal conversion is mathematically hard.
        <br>Enter <strong>Hexadecimal (Base-16)</strong>.
        <br>0-9 and A-F (where A=10, F=15).
        <br>One Hex digit represents exactly 4 binary bits (One Nibble). It is the shorthand used by programmers for
        colors (#FF0000) and memory addresses.
    </p>

    <h2 id="logic">Boolean Logic</h2>
    <p>
        Computers "think" using logic gates.
        <br><strong>AND Gate:</strong> Output 1 only if Input A AND Input B are 1.
        <br><strong>OR Gate:</strong> Output 1 if Input A OR Input B is 1.
        <br><strong>NOT Gate:</strong> Flips the bit (1 becomes 0).
        <br>By combining billions of these gates, we get CPUs that can play video games.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Who invented binary?</h4>
            <p>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1679. But he didn't have computers. Claude Shannon applied it to circuits in
                1937.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. What is 256?</h4>
            <p>2^8. The number of values in a Byte (0-255). Famous in Pacman (Level 256 glitch) and RGB colors (256
