    <h1>Inflation Calculator: The Silent Thief</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        You've heard your grandparents say, "In my time, a movie ticket cost ₹2!". Today it costs ₹300. That is
        <strong>Inflation</strong>. It is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is
        rising, and consequently, the purchasing power of currency is falling. This calculator helps you travel through
        time to see what money was worth then, and what it will be worth in the future.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Does Money Lose Value?</h2>
    <p>
        Economies grow, money supply increases, and demand rises. A small, steady inflation (2-4%) is actually consider
        good for the economy as it encourages spending.
        <br>However, for a saver, it is an enemy. If you hide ₹1 Lakh under your mattress today, in 10 years it will
        still be ₹1 Lakh, but it will buy only half the things it buys today.
    </p>

    <h2>The Rule of 72 (Inflation Edition)</h2>
    <p>
        Divide 72 by the inflation rate to see when your prices double.
        <br>At 6% inflation, prices double every 12 years (72/6 = 12).
        <br>So if you need ₹50,000/month today, you will need ₹1,00,000/month in 12 years just to survive.
