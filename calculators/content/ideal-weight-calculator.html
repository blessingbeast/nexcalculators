    <h1>Ideal Weight Calculator: Finding Your Healthy Zone</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        In a society obsessed with image, "Ideal Weight" is a loaded term. Is it the weight of a supermodel? The weight
        of a CrossFit athlete? Or the weight your doctor recommends? The truth is, there is no single "Perfect" number.
        However, medical science has developed formulas over decades to estimate a healthy weight range based on height
        and frame. This calculator uses the <strong>Devine Formula</strong> (the medical standard) to give you a
        realistic target for longevity and health.

    <h2 id="history">The History of Ideal Weight</h2>
    <p>
        Before BMI became popular, insurance companies in the 1940s created "Height-Weight Tables" to determine
        premiums. They noticed that people who weighed significantly more (or less) than average for their height tended
        to die younger.
        <br>Later, pharmacologists needed formulas to calculate drug dosages (some medicines are dosed by lean body
        mass, not total mass). This led to the creation of equations like the Devine Formula in 1974.
    </p>

    <h2 id="formulas">Battle of Formulas</h2>
    <p>Our calculator uses the Devine Formula, but here are the others for context:</p>

    <h3>1. B.J. Devine Formula (1974)</h3>
    <p>Most widely used.
        <br><strong>Men:</strong> 50.0 kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet.
        <br><strong>Women:</strong> 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Robinson Formula (1983)</h3>
    <p>Slightly different adjustment.
        <br><strong>Men:</strong> 52 kg + 1.9 kg per inch over 5 feet.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Miller Formula (1983)</h3>
    <p>Often used for very tall/short people.</p>

    <h2 id="limitations">Why "Ideal" Might Be Wrong for You</h2>
    <p>
        These formulas assume an "Average Frame".
        <br><strong>1. Muscle Mass:</strong> If you lift weights, you will weight 5-10kg MORE than the ideal weight, but
        be healthier. The formula sees muscle as excess weight.
        <br><strong>2. Frame Size:</strong> Wrist circumference matters. A broad-shouldered "Viking" build cannot
        healthy fit into a weight designed for a slender runner.
        <br><strong>3. Age:</strong> Studies show that carrying a little extra weight (BMI 25-27) in old age (65+) is
        actually protective against frailty and falls.
    </p>

    <h2 id="healthy-weight">Ideal Weight vs Healthy Weight</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Ideal Weight:</strong> A statistical average derived from data.
        <br><strong>Healthy Weight:</strong> The weight where YOU feel good, have high energy, and perfect blood markers
        (Cholesterol, Sugar, BP).
        <br>Don't chase the number on this calculator if it means starving yourself. Use it as a ballpark guide. If the
        calculator says 70kg and you are 75kg but lean and fit, ignore the calculator.

    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Does this apply to children?</h4>
            <p>No! Children grow at varying rates. Use Pediatric Growth Charts (Percentiles) from the WHO or CDC for
                anyone under 18.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. I am 10kg over the ideal. Am I obese?</h4>
            <p>Not necessarily. Check your Body Fat Percentage. If the extra 10kg is muscle, you are an athlete. If it's
                belly fat, you might need to diet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. Why is the female number lower?</h4>
            <p>Women generally have less bone density and muscle mass than men of the same height, leading to a lighter
                "lean mass" baseline.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. How to adjust for frame size?</h4>
            <p>A rule of thumb is to adjust the result by ±10%. Small frame (-10%), Large frame (+10%).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Does ideal weight change with age?</h4>
            <p>The formula doesn't change, but medical advice does. Doctors are more lenient with weight as you age.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Relationship with BMI?</h4>
            <p>The "Ideal Weight" usually lands right in the middle of the "Normal BMI" range (BMI 21-22).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. What about water weight?</h4>
            <p>Your weight fluctuates 1-2kg daily. Always weigh yourself in the morning, naked, after using the toilet
                for True Weight.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. I can't reach this number!</h4>
            <p>Genetics play a role. Some people have a "Set Point" weight. Fighting nature to become stick-thin is not
                healthy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. Does pregnancy count?</h4>
            <p>No. Pregnancy weight gain is essential. Do not try to maintain "Ideal Weight" while pregnant!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. Metric vs Imperial?</h4>
            <p>The world is split, but the calculator handles the conversion. 1kg = 2.2lbs.</p>
