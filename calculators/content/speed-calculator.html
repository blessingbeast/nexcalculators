    <h1>Speed Calculator: The Physics of Motion</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        "I feel the need... the need for speed!" From cheetahs to fighter jets, speed captivates us. But fundamentally,
        speed is just a relationship between Space and Time. This <strong>Speed Calculator</strong> solves the basic
        kinematic equation: Speed = Distance / Time. Whether you're a runner tracking your pace, a driver estimating
        arrival time, or a student solving physics problems, this tool handles the conversions and the math.

    <h2 id="formula">The DST Triangle</h2>
    <p>
        The relationship is linear:
        <br><strong>Speed (S) = Distance (D) / Time (T)</strong>
        <br><strong>Distance (D) = Speed (S) × Time (T)</strong>
        <br><strong>Time (T) = Distance (D) / Speed (S)</strong>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Units matter!</strong>
        <br>If Distance is km and Time is hours -> Speed is km/h.
        <br>If Distance is meters and Time is seconds -> Speed is m/s.
        <br>To convert km/h to m/s: Divide by 3.6.
    </p>

    <h2 id="velocity">Speed vs Velocity</h2>
    <p>
        In everyday language, they are the same. In Physics:
        <br><strong>Speed</strong> is a Scalar quantity. It has magnitude only. (e.g., "The car is moving at 50 km/h").
        <br><strong>Velocity</strong> is a Vector quantity. It has magnitude AND direction. (e.g., "The car is moving at
        50 km/h North").
        <br>If you drive in a circle and come back to the start, your Average Speed is 50 km/h, but your Average
        Velocity is Zero (because displacement is zero).
    </p>

    <h2 id="limits">The Cosmic Speed Limit</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Speed of light (c):</strong> 299,792,458 m/s.
        <br>According to Einstein's relativity, nothing with mass can travel at or faster than light. As you approach
        'c', your mass becomes infinite and time stops.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Speed of Sound (Mach 1):</strong> ~343 m/s (in air).
        <br>When a jet breaks this barrier, it creates a Sonic Boom. The Concorde cruised at Mach 2.
    </p>

    <h2 id="relative">Relative Speed</h2>
    <p>
        Why does a car next to you on the highway look like it's not moving?
        <br><strong>Same Direction:</strong> Relative Speed = Speed A - Speed B. (100 - 90 = 10 km/h).
        <br><strong>Opposite Direction:</strong> Relative Speed = Speed A + Speed B. (100 + 90 = 190 km/h).
        <br>This is why head-on collisions are so deadly. The impact energy is massive.

    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Knot vs mph?</h4>
            <p>1 Knot = 1 Nautical Mile per hour = 1.15 mph. Used for ships/planes because nautical miles track the
                curvature of the earth (1 minute of latitude).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. What is Terminal Velocity?</h4>
            <p>The max speed a falling object reaches when air resistance equals gravity. For a human skydiver, it's
                ~200 km/h.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. How fast does Earth spin?</h4>
            <p>At the equator, ~1600 km/h. But we don't feel it because the atmosphere moves with us.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. Average vs Instantaneous Speed?</h4>
            <p>Speedometer shows Instantaneous. Trip computer shows Average (Total Dist / Total Time).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Fastest land animal?</h4>
            <p>Cheetah. ~110 km/h in short bursts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Fastest man?</h4>
            <p>Usain Bolt. ~44.72 km/h (top speed).</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. 0-60 mph?</h4>
            <p>Standard acceleration metric for cars. Modern EVs (Tesla Plaid) do it in < 2 seconds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. Tachometer vs Speedometer?</h4>
            <p>Tachometer measures Engine Speed (RPM). Speedometer measures Vehicle Speed (km/h).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. What is Warp Speed?</h4>
            <p>Fictional code from Star Trek. Warp 1 = Light Speed. Warp 9 = 834x Light Speed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. Why use km/h not m/s?</h4>
            <p>Convenience. km/h gives human-scale numbers (0-100). m/s is better for physics calculations.</p>
