    <h1>GST Calculator: Simplifying the One Nation, One Tax</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        The Goods and Services Tax (GST) was a watershed moment in India's economic history, aimed at removing cascading
        taxes and creating a unified market. Whether you are a business owner generating invoices, a freelancer quoting
        a client, or a consumer checking a restaurant bill, calculating GST accurately is part of daily life. This
        <strong>GST Calculator</strong> is a dual-purpose tool: it helps you add tax to a base price (Exclusive) and
        remove tax from a final price (Inclusive).
    </p>

    <h2>What is GST?</h2>
    <p>
        GST is an indirect tax levied on the supply of goods and services. It is a comprehensive, multi-stage,
        destination-based tax:
        <br><strong>Comprehensive:</strong> It subsumed almost all indirect taxes (Excise, VAT, Service Tax).
        <br><strong>Multi-stage:</strong> It is imposed at every step in the production process where value is added.
        <br><strong>Destination-based:</strong> The tax is collected by the state where the goods are consumed, not
        where they are made.
    </p>

    <h2>The 3 Components of GST</h2>
    <p>Understanding the split is crucial for businesses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>CGST (Central GST):</strong> Goes to the Central Government.</li>
        <li><strong>SGST (State GST):</strong> Goes to the State Government.</li>
        <li><strong>IGST (Integrated GST):</strong> Collected by Centre on Inter-state supply.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you sell within the state (Intra-state): CGST + SGST applies (e.g., 9% + 9% = 18%).
        <br>If you sell to another state (Inter-state): IGST applies (flat 18%).
    </p>

    <h2>How to Calculate GST?</h2>

    <h3>Method 1: GST Exclusive (Adding Tax)</h3>
    <p>
        Use this when you have a base price and need to generate an invoice.
        <br><em>Base Price: ₹1,000</em>
        <br><em>GST Rate: 18%</em>
        <br>Calculation: 1000 * (18/100) = ₹180 Tax.
        <br>Total Invoice Value: ₹1,180.
    </p>

    <h3>Method 2: GST Inclusive (Reverse Calculation)</h3>
    <p>
        Use this when you have a final MRP and want to know the tax component.
        <br><em>Total Price: ₹1,180</em>
        <br><em>GST Rate: 18%</em>
        <br>Formula: Total / (1 + Rate/100)
        <br>Calculation: 1180 / 1.18 = ₹1,000 (Base Price).
        <br>Tax Component: 1180 - 1000 = ₹180.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is Reverse Calculation Difficult?</h2>
    <p>
        Many people make the mistake of simply subtracting 18% from the total.
        <br>18% of 1180 is 212.4. If you subtract that, you get 967.6, which is WRONG.
        <br>Always use the reverse formula provided by our calculator to avoid accounting errors.
    </p>

    <h2>Current GST Slab Rates</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>0% (Nil Rated):</strong> Fresh milk, vegetables, grains, salt.</li>
        <li><strong>5%:</strong> Spices, oil, tea, coffee, life-saving drugs.</li>
        <li><strong>12%:</strong> Processed food, computers, cycles.</li>
        <li><strong>18%:</strong> Most services, soaps, toothpaste, electronics, capital goods. (Most common slab).</li>
        <li><strong>28%:</strong> Luxury cars, ACs, cement, aerated drinks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Input Tax Credit (ITC)</h2>
    <p>
        This is the soul of GST. It prevents "Tax on Tax".
        <br>If a manufacturer pays ₹100 tax on raw materials and collects ₹150 tax on finished goods, he only deposits
        ₹50 (150 - 100) to the government. This flow of credit ensures efficiency.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Mistakes in GST calculation can lead to statutory penalties and loss of client trust. Whether you are generating
        e-invoices or verifying vendor bills, precision is non-negotiable. Use this tool to ensure your financial
        compliance is spot on.
