    <h2 id="what-is-rd">What is a Recurring Deposit?</h2>
    <p>
        A Recurring Deposit (RD) is a special type of term deposit offered by banks and Post Offices. Unlike a Fixed
        Deposit (FD) where you invest once, an RD involves depositing a fixed amount of money every month for a
        pre-determined tenure.
        <br><br>
        <strong>The Contract:</strong> You agree to pay, say, ₹5,000 on the 5th of every month for 3 years. In return,
        the bank gives you interest rates similar to (or sometimes higher than) FDs.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Maturity:</strong> At the end of the tenure (e.g., 36 months), you get back your total Principal (₹5000
        x 36) + Total Accumulated Interest.
    </p>

    <h2 id="logic">The Complex Logic of RD Interest</h2>
    <p>
        Calculating interest on an FD is easy—Principal is constant. But in an RD, calculate is tricky because every
        Installment stays with the bank for a <em>different</em> duration.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Example: 12 Month RD</strong>
        <br>- <strong>Month 1 Installment:</strong> Stays with bank for 12 months. Earns max interest.
        <br>- <strong>Month 2 Installment:</strong> Stays with bank for 11 months.
        <br>- <strong>Month 12 Installment:</strong> Stays with bank for only 1 month. Earns min interest.
        <br><br>
        Banks use the formula for quarterly compounding on each installment individually.
        <br><em>Total Interest = Sum of compound interest on each installment.</em>
        <br>Our calculator automates this complex iterative math instantly, showing you the exact maturity value.

    <h2 id="rd-vs-sip">RD vs SIP: The Great Debate</h2>
    <p>
        In the age of Mutual Funds, people often ask: "Why RD? Why not SIP?"

    <p>
        <strong>Verdict:</strong> Use RD for goals that are less than 3 years away where you cannot afford to lose
        money. Use SIP for long-term wealth where you can ride out market volatility.

    <h2 id="strategies">Who Should Open an RD?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Students:</strong> Saving pocket money to buy a gadget.</li>
        <li><strong>Salaried Professionals:</strong> Automating savings immediately after salary credit to prevent
            overspending.</li>
        <li><strong>Parents:</strong> Saving for annual school fees. Open a 12-month RD in April, so it matures next
            March just in time for school fees.</li>
        <li><strong>Tenants:</strong> Saving for the annual rent deposit or escalation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="tips">Smart RD Tips</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>1. Use "Flexi RD":</strong> Standard RDs penalize you if you miss a payment. Flexi RDs (like SBI Holiday
        Savings or iWish) allow you to deposit varying amounts whenever you have cash, without strict dates.
        <br><strong>2. Align with Goals:</strong> Don't just save randomly. Name your RD. "Europe Trip 2025" RD will
        motivate you not to break it.
        <br><strong>3. Post Office RD:</strong> Post Office RDs are 5-year schemes with sovereign guarantees and often
        offer slightly better interest rates than banks. Great for long-term safe saving.
        <br><strong>4. Avoid Premature Closure:</strong> Breaking an RD attracts a 1% penalty on interest. If you need
        money, try a loan against the RD instead.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. What happens if I miss a monthly installment?</h4>
            <p>Most banks charge a penalty (e.g., ₹1.50 per ₹100 per month). If you miss multiple months, the bank may
                close the account and refund the money with simple savings interest.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. Is RD interest taxable?</h4>
            <p>Yes. Just like FD, RD interest is fully taxable. TDS @ 10% is deducted if total interest in a year
                exceeds ₹40,000.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. Can I vary the installment amount?</h4>

                contribution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">

            <h4>5. Can I open RD in the name of a minor?</h4>

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Senior Citizen Benefits?</h4>

            <h4>7. Can I confirm the date of deduction?</h4>
            <p>Yes, you can usually choose the 'Standing Instruction' date. Ideally, set it 2-3 days after your salary
                date.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. Loan against RD?</h4>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. Is Post Office RD better than Bank RD?</h4>
            <p>Post Office RD is non-flexible (5 Year Lock-in) but very safe. Bank RD offers flexibility (6 months to 10
                years). Choose based on your time horizon.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. How is maturity calculated if I pay late?</h4>
            <p>The maturity amount decreases because the delayed installment earns interest for fewer days, and the
                penalty is deducted.</p>
