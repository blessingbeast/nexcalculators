    <h1>SIP Calculator: The Eighth Wonder of the World</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        Albert Einstein famously said, <em>"Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it,
            earns it... he who doesn't, pays it."</em> In the world of modern investing, the <strong>Systematic
            Investment Plan (SIP)</strong> is the most accessible vehicle to ride this wonder. SIP is not a product; it
        is a philosophy. It is the philosophy of discipline, patience, and consistency. This calculator allows you to
        visualize how small, regular contributions can snowball into a massive fortune over time.

    <h2>What is a SIP?</h2>
    <p>
        A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is a method of investing in Mutual Funds where an investor chooses to invest
        a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (usually monthly).
        <br>Think of it like a convenient Recurring Deposit (RD), but instead of the bank, the money goes into the stock
        or bond markets where the potential for growth is significantly higher.
    </p>

    <h2>The Mechanics of Wealth Creation</h2>
    <p>
        SIPs work on two powerful principles:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Rupee Cost Averaging</h3>
    <p>
        Timing the market (buying low and selling high) is incredibly difficult, even for professionals. SIP eliminates
        this need.
        <br>- When the market is <strong>High</strong> (Expensive), your fixed entitlement buys <strong>fewer
            units</strong>.
        <br>- When the market is <strong>Low</strong> (Cheap), your fixed entitlement buys <strong>more units</strong>.
        <br>Over time, your average cost of acquisition drops lower than the average market price. You automatically buy
        the dip without watching the news!
    </p>

    <h3>2. Power of Compounding</h3>
    <p>
        Compounding is when your earnings generate their own earnings.
        <br>In Year 1, you earn returns on your principal.
        <br>In Year 2, you earn returns on your principal + Year 1 returns.
        <br>After 10 or 20 years, the "interest on interest" component becomes larger than your actual investment.
    </p>

    <h2>The Cost of Delay</h2>
    <p>
        The most critical factor in SIP is not money; it is <strong>Time</strong>.
        <br><strong>Scenario A:</strong> Start at age 25, invest ₹5,000/month for 10 years, then stop but let it grow
        till age 60.
        <br><strong>Scenario B:</strong> Start at age 35, invest ₹5,000/month for 25 years till age 60.
        <br>Surprisingly, Scenario A often results in more wealth despite investing less money, simply because the money
        had 10 extra years to compound. <strong>Start early, even if it's small.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Asset Classes for SIP</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Equity Funds:</strong> Invest in stocks. High risk, high return (12-15%). Best for long term (>5
            years).</li>
        <li><strong>Debt Funds:</strong> Invest in bonds. Low risk, moderate return (7-9%). Best for medium term (2-3
            years).</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid Funds:</strong> Mix of both. Balanced risk and return.</li>
        <li><strong>ELSS:</strong> Equity funds that come with tax benefits u/s 80C.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Inflation: The Invisible Enemy</h2>
    <p>
        Why not just save in a bank? Because of inflation. If inflation is 6% and your bank gives 3%, you are
        effectively losing 3% purchasing power every year. Equity SIPs are one of the few instruments that consistently
        beat inflation by a wide margin (generating "Real Returns").
    </p>

    <h2>Steps to Start a SIP</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>KYC Compliance:</strong> Submit PAN and Aadhaar to a fund house (one-time).</li>
        <li><strong>Choose a Fund:</strong> Based on your risk appetite (Large Cap, Mid Cap, Index Fund).</li>
        <li><strong>Set Mandate:</strong> Register a bank mandate so the amount is auto-debited.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Review (don't obsess!) once every 6 months or 1 year.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Wealth creation is boring. It's about doing the same boring thing (investing) month after month for decades. But
        the result is exciting. Use this <strong>SIP Calculator</strong> to set your goals. Whether it's ₹1 Crore for
        retirement or ₹20 Lakhs for a child's education, the math will show you the path. Your job is simply to walk it.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Is SIP a product?</h4>
            <p>No, SIP is a <em>method</em> of investing. You can do a SIP in Mutual Funds, Gold, or even stocks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. What is the minimum amount?</h4>
            <p>Most funds allow SIPs starting as low as ₹500 per month, making it accessible to students and beginners.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. How much tax do I pay?</h4>
            <p>For Equity: 10% on gains above ₹1 Lakh (LTCG). For Debt: Taxed at your income slab rate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. What if I miss a monthly payment?</h4>
            <p>Nothing bad happens. The SIP for that month is skipped. The fund house won't charge a penalty, though
                your bank might charge for a failed mandate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Should I stop SIP when markets crash?</h4>
            <p><strong>Absolutely NOT!</strong> That is the worst mistake. A market crash is the "sale" period where
                your SIP buys more units at cheap prices. Continue or increase SIP during crashes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Can I increase my SIP amount?</h4>
            <p>Yes, use a "Step-Up SIP" or simply start a fresh SIP in the same fund.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. How many funds should I have?</h4>
            <p>Don't over-diversify. 3-4 good funds (1 Flexicap, 1 Midcap, 1 Index) are usually enough for most
                investors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. What is a "Direct" fund?</h4>
            <p>Always choose "Direct" plans over "Regular" plans. Regular plans pay commission to agents from your
                money, reducing your returns by ~1% every year.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. Is SIP safe?</h4>
            <p>SIPs in safe instruments (like Liquid Funds) are very safe. SIPs in Equity are volatile but historically
                have never lost money over 10+ year periods.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. Withdraw anytime?</h4>
            <p>Yes (except ELSS which has 3-year lock-in). Money usually hits your bank in 2-3 working days.</p>
