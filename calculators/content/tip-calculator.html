    <h1>Tip Calculator: The Etiquette of Gratuity</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        Tipping is more than just math; it is a social contract, a reward for service, and in some countries, the
        primary livelihood of the staff. But the rules change the moment you cross a border. Do you tip 20%? 10%?
        Nothing? Is the service charge already included? This <strong>Tip Calculator</strong> handles the math of
        splitting bills and calculating percentages, allowing you to dine with dignity and generosity.

    <h2 id="usa">The US Tipping Culture</h2>
    <p>
        In the United States, tipping is <strong>Mandatory</strong> in practice, if not in law.
        <br><strong>Why?</strong> The federal minimum wage for tipped employees can be as low as $2.13/hour. They
        literally survive on your tips.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Standard Rates:</strong>
        <br><strong>15%:</strong> Minimum/Average Service.
        <br><strong>18-20%:</strong> Good Service. (This is the new normal).
        <br><strong>25%+:</strong> Exceptional Service.
        <br><strong>0-10%:</strong> You are making a huge statement that service was terrible. Expect confrontation.
    </p>

    <h2 id="global">Tipping Around the World</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Europe:</strong> Service is usually included "Service Compris". A small tip (Euro 1-2 per person) or
        rounding up is polite but not required.
        <br><strong>Japan/Korea:</strong> Tipping is culturally <strong>Offensive</strong>. Perfect service is expected
        as a duty. Leaving money can cause the staff to chase you down to return your "forgotten" change.
        <br><strong>India:</strong> 5-10% is standard in restaurants. Small fixed amounts (₹20-50) for porters/valets.
        <br><strong>Dubai/ME:</strong> 10-15% is standard despite high service charges.
    </p>

    <h2 id="math">How to Calculate Quickly</h2>
    <p>
        Don't have a calculator?
        <br><strong>The 10% Method:</strong> Move the decimal one spot left.
        <br>Bill: $45.00 -> 10% is $4.50.
        <br><strong>For 20%:</strong> Double the 10%. ($4.50 x 2 = $9.00).
        <br><strong>For 15%:</strong> Take 10% ($4.50) + Half of that ($2.25) = $6.75.
    </p>

    <h2 id="service-charge">Service Charge vs Tip</h2>
    <p>
        Check your bill carefully!
        <br><strong>Service Charge:</strong> A mandatory fee (usually 10%) added by the restaurant. This is
        tax-compliant income for the restaurant, which may or may not reach the waiter.
        <br><strong>Service Tax / GST:</strong> This goes to the Government. Never tip on the tax amount. Tip on the
        pre-tax subtotal.
        <br><strong>Tip/Gratuity:</strong> Voluntary money left for the server. This usually goes directly to them.
        <br><em>Rule: If Service Charge is added, you do not need to tip extra unless you want to.</em>
