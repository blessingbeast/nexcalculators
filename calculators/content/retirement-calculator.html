    <h1>Retirement Calculator: Secure Your Second Innings</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        Retirement is the only financial goal you cannot get a loan for. You can borrow for a house, a car, or
        education, but no bank will lend you money for your old age. You rely entirely on the corpus you build today.
        This <strong>Retirement Calculator</strong> estimates the massive number you need (Your "Number") to maintain
        your lifestyle when the paycheck stops.
    </p>

    <h2>The 25x Rule (FIRE Movement)</h2>
    <p>
        A general rule of thumb: You need <strong>25 times your annual expenses</strong> to retire.
        <br>If you spend ₹10 Lakhs a year, you need ₹2.5 Crores.
        <br>This assumes you withdraw 4% annually (Safe Withdrawal Rate) and the corpus lasts 30 years.
    </p>

    <h2>The Inflation Factor</h2>
    <p>
        Currently spending ₹50,000/month? In 20 years (at 6% inflation), you will need ₹1,60,000/month to buy the
        <em>same</em> things. Your corpus target must account for this future value.
