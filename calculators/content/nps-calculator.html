    <h1>NPS Calculator: The Modern Retirement Solution</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        Old pensions are gone. The days of "Defined Benefit" where the government paid you a salary till death are over.
        Welcome to the era of "Defined Contribution". The <strong>National Pension System (NPS)</strong> is India's
        answer to social security. It is a government-sponsored, market-linked retirement vehicle that allows you to
        build a massive corpus with very little cost. Whether you are a government employee, corporate professional, or
        self-employed, NPS is likely the most efficient way to plan for your golden years.

    <h2 id="structure">The Two Tiers of NPS</h2>
    <p>NPS offers two types of accounts:</p>

    <h3>1. Tier I (The Pension Account)</h3>
    <p>
        This is the core retirement account.
        <br><strong>Status:</strong> Mandatory for Govt employees, Voluntary for others.
        <br><strong>Lock-in:</strong> Locked till age 60. (Partial withdrawals allowed under strict conditions).
        <br><strong>Tax Benefit:</strong> Eligible for 80C and 80CCD(1B) deductions.
        <br><strong>Minimum Contribution:</strong> ₹1000 per year.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Tier II (The Investment Account)</h3>
    <p>
        This works like a mutual fund savings account.
        <br><strong>Status:</strong> Optional. You need an active Tier I account to open this.
        <br><strong>Lock-in:</strong> None. Determine anytime.
        <br><strong>Tax Benefit:</strong> None (except for Govt employees with 3-year lock-in).
        <br><strong>Use Case:</strong> Parking surplus funds with low management fees.
    </p>

    <h2 id="investment">Where is the Money Invested?</h2>
    <p>
        Unlike PPF (100% Debt), NPS allows you to invest in Equity (Stocks). This is key to beating inflation over 30
        years. You can choose from 3 asset classes:
        <br><strong>E (Equity):</strong> Stocks. High risk, High return. (Max capped at 75%).
        <br><strong>C (Corporate Bonds):</strong> Debt instruments of companies. Medium risk.
        <br><strong>G (Government Securities):</strong> Sovereign bonds. Low risk, Low return.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Investment Modes:</strong>
        <br><strong>Active Choice:</strong> You decide the percentage (e.g., 50% E, 30% C, 20% G).
        <br><strong>Auto Choice (Lifecycle Fund):</strong> The system automatically reduces your Equity exposure as you
        age to protect your corpus.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tax">Exclusive Tax Benefits (₹50,000 Extra)</h2>
    <p>
        NPS is the only instrument that gives you tax deduction <em>over and above</em> the ₹1.5 Lakh 80C limit.
        <br><strong>Section 80CCD(1):</strong> Up to ₹1.5 Lakh (Within overall 80C).
        <br><strong>Section 80CCD(1B):</strong> Additional ₹50,000 deduction exclusively for NPS.
        <br><strong>Section 80CCD(2):</strong> Employer contribution (up to 10% of Basic+DA) is fully tax-free. This is
        huge for corporate employees.
    </p>

    <h2 id="exit">Withdrawal Rules at Age 60</h2>
    <p>
        When you turn 60, your NPS matures.
        <br><strong>60% of Corpus:</strong> You can withdraw this as a Lump Sum. It is FULLY TAX-FREE.
        <br><strong>40% of Corpus:</strong> You MUST use this to buy an "Annuity Plan" from an insurance provider. This
        amount is not taxed initially, but the monthly pension you receive from it will be taxed as income.
    </p>

    <h2 id="annuity">Understanding Annuity</h2>
    <p>
        An Annuity is the reverse of insurance. You pay a lump sum to an insurer (like LIC/HDFC Life), and they pay you
        a fixed monthly pension for life.
        <br>Example: If you buy an annuity for ₹1 Crore, you might get approximately ₹50,000 - ₹60,000 per month for
        life (depending on prevailing rates, approx 6-7%).
