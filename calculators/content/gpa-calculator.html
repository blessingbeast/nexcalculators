    <h1>GPA Calculator: The Scorecard of Academia</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        In the high-stakes world of education, three letters determine your fate: <strong>GPA (Grade Point
            Average)</strong>. It is the gatekeeper for scholarships, university admissions, and even your first job.
        But how is it actually calculated? Why is an 'A' in AP Math worth more than an 'A' in Gym? This <strong>GPA
            Calculator</strong> demystifies the weighted and unweighted systems, allowing you to track your academic
        standing with precision.

    <h2 id="math">The Math Behind GPA</h2>
    <p>
        GPA is essentially an average of your performance, weighted by the "Credit Value" of the course.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Step 1: Assign Points</strong>
        <br>A = 4.0
        <br>B = 3.0
        <br>C = 2.0
        <br>D = 1.0
        <br>F = 0.0
        <br><br>
        <strong>Step 2: Multiply by Credits</strong>
        <br>Math (4 Credits) with Grade A: 4 * 4 = 16 Quality Points.
        <br>History (3 Credits) with Grade B: 3 * 3 = 9 Quality Points.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Step 3: Average</strong>
        <br>Total Points (25) / Total Credits (7) = <strong>3.57 GPA</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="weighted">Weighted vs Unweighted GPA</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Unweighted (Standard):</strong> Max is 4.0. It treats all classes equally. An A in Advanced Physics is
        the same as an A in Pottery.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Weighted:</strong> Rewards difficulty. Max can be 5.0 or 6.0.
        <br>- AP / IB Classes: A = 5.0
        <br>- Honors Classes: A = 4.5
        <br>- Standard Classes: A = 4.0
        <br>Colleges prefer Weighted GPA because it shows you challenged yourself. A 3.8 Weighted (with hard classes) is
        often better than a 4.0 Unweighted (with easy classes).
    </p>

    <h2 id="conversions">Converting Percentage to GPA</h2>
    <p>
        Education systems vary globally.
        <br><strong>USA:</strong> 4.0 Scale.
        <br><strong>India (CBSE):</strong> 10.0 CGPA Scale. (To get %, multiply by 9.5).
        <br><strong>UK:</strong> Honors System (First Class, 2:1, etc).
        <br>When applying abroad, never convert manually. Use WES (World Education Services) or the university's
        specific conversion chart.
    </p>

    <h2 id="strategies">Strategies to Boost Your GPA</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Front-Load Effort:</strong> It is mathematically easier to maintain a high GPA than to fix a low
            one. Get A's in freshman year.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect the Credits:</strong> A 4-credit class impacts your GPA twice as much as a 2-credit class.
            Prioritize studying for credit-heavy subjects.</li>
        <li><strong>Withdraw (W) vs Fail (F):</strong> If you are failing, withdraw before the deadline. A 'W' is
            neutral; an 'F' is a GPA nuke (0 points).</li>
        <li><strong>Office Hours:</strong> Professors grade subjectively sometimes. Showing effort can bump a B+ to an
            A-.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="life">Does GPA Matter in Real Life?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Yes:</strong> For Graduate School (Masters/PhD/MBA) and your very first job interview. Top firms
        (Goldman Sachs, weakness) filter resumes by GPA.
        <br><strong>No:</strong> 5 years into your career. Nobody asks a Senior Engineer what their college GPA was.
        Experience is king.

    <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Cumulative vs Semester GPA?</h4>
            <p>Semester GPA is for one term. Cumulative is the average of ALL terms. Cumulative is what appears on your
                transcript.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. Pass/Fail classes?</h4>
            <p>They generally do not affect GPA. They count towards graduation credits but have 0 quality points.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. What is Summa Cum Laude?</h4>
            <p>Latin Honors. Summa (Highest - Top 1%), Magna (High - Top 5%), Cum Laude (With Honors - Top 10-15%).
                Usually requires GPA > 3.8.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. How does Retaking a class work?</h4>
            <p>Depends on policy. "Grade Replacement" deletes the F and uses the new grade. "Grade Averaging" keeps
                both. Replacement is much better for GPA.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Perfect 4.0?</h4>
            <p>Difficult and rare. Don't stress perfect perfection. A 3.8+ opens almost all the same doors as a 4.0.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. Does attendance affect GPA?</h4>
            <p>Indirectly, yes! Missing class is the #1 predictor of low grades.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. 10.0 to 4.0 Conversion?</h4>
            <p>Roughly: 9-10 = 4.0 (A). 8-9 = 3.5 (A/B). 7-8 = 3.0 (B). But official conversion is complex.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. Dean's List?</h4>
            <p>An academic honor roll for students achieving a high GPA (usually >3.5) in a specific semester.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. Can I round up?</h4>
            <p>Never round up (e.g., 3.49 is not 3.5) on a resume unless explicitly told. It can be seen as lying.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. Average GPA?</h4>
            <p>The average college GPA in the US is approx 3.1. Due to "Grade Inflation", this average has been rising
                over decades.</p>
