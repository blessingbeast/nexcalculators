    <h2 id="formula">The ROI Formula</h2>
    <p>
        The concept is simple: Profit divided by Cost.
        <br><br>
        <strong>ROI = [(Current Value - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment] × 100</strong>
        <br><br>
        Example:
        <br>You buy a house for ₹50 Lakhs.
        <br>You sell it for ₹60 Lakhs.
        <br>Gain = 10 Lakhs.
        <br>ROI = (10 / 50) × 100 = <strong>20%</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="applications">Where to Use ROI?</h2>

    <h3>1. Stock Market</h3>
    <p>Comparing performance of Stock A vs Stock B.
        <br>Stock A: Invested 10k, Current 12k. ROI 20%.
        <br>Stock B: Invested 50k, Current 55k. ROI 10%.
        <br>Stock A is the better performer despite lower absolute profit.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Real Estate</h3>
    <p>Factoring in Renovation costs, Stamp Duty, and Rental Income.
        <br>Cost = Purchase + Renovation.
        <br>Return = Selling Price + Total Rent Collected.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Marketing Campaigns</h3>
    <p>Spent ₹1 Lakh on Facebook Ads. Generated ₹5 Lakhs in Sales.
        <br>Marketing ROI (ROAS) = 400%.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Education</h3>
    <p>Cost of MBA = ₹20 Lakhs. Salary Hike = ₹10 Lakhs/year.
        <br>Break-even in 2 years. ROI is positive thereafter.
    </p>

    <h2 id="annualized">The Trap of Time (Annualized ROI)</h2>
    <p>
        Basic ROI has a major flaw: <strong>It ignores time.</strong>
        <br><br>
        Scenario A: 20% Return in 1 Year.
        <br>Scenario B: 20% Return in 10 Years.
        <br><br>
        Both have 20% ROI. But Scenario A is fantastic wealth creation, while Scenario B is a disaster (losing to
        inflation).
        <br>Always look at <strong>Annualized ROI (CAGR)</strong> for investments longer than 1 year.
    </p>

    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations of Basic ROI</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Risk Ignorance:</strong> A lottery ticket has high ROI but 99.9% risk of loss. ROI doesn't show
            risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Cash Flow Timing:</strong> It doesn't account for <em>when</em> the money comes back. (Use NPV/IRR
            for that).</li>
        <li><strong>Opportunity Cost:</strong> It doesn't tell you what <em>else</em> you could have done with that
            money.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. Is high ROI always better?</h4>
            <p>Not always. High ROI usually comes with High Risk. A scam might promise 100% ROI in a month. Always

            <h4>2. How to calculate ROI on Cash purchase vs Loan?</h4>
            <p>Using a loan (Leverage) increases ROI. Because your "Cost" is only the downpayment, but you get
                appreciation on the full asset value (Cash-on-Cash Return).</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
