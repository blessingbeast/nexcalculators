    <h2 id="how">How Due Date is Calculated (Naegele's Rule)</h2>
    <p>
        You might think pregnancy starts when you conceive (sex). But doctors calculate it from the <strong>First Day of
            your Last Menstrual Period (LMP)</strong>.
        <br><br>
        <strong>The Math:</strong> LMP + 7 Days - 3 Months + 1 Year.
        <br>OR simply: LMP + 280 Days (40 Weeks).
        <br><br>
        <em>Why LMP?</em> Because most women know when their period started, but few know exactly which day they
        ovulated or conceived. Since ovulation usually happens 14 days after LMP, the first "2 weeks" of your pregnancy
        you aren't actually pregnant yet!

    <h2 id="trimesters">The 3 Trimesters Explained</h2>

    <h3>First Trimester (Weeks 1-12)</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Baby:</strong> Goes from a single cell to a distinct fetus with heartbeat, fingers, and toes.
        <br><strong>Mom:</strong> Morning sickness, fatigue, breast tenderness. Risk of miscarriage is highest here.
    </p>

    <h3>Second Trimester (Weeks 13-27) - The "Golden Period"</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Baby:</strong> Grows rapidly. Starts kicking (Quickening). Can hear your voice. Sex can be determined
        via Ultrasound (Week 20).
        <br><strong>Mom:</strong> Nausea fades, energy returns. The "Baby Bump" shows.
    </p>

    <h3>Third Trimester (Weeks 28-40)</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Baby:</strong> Puts on fat. Lungs mature. Turns head-down for birth.
        <br><strong>Mom:</strong> Physical discomfort. Back pain, frequent urination, difficulty sleeping. Nesting
        instinct kicks in.
    </p>

    <h2 id="milestones">Key Developmental Milestones</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Week 6:</strong> Heartbeat detectable on ultrasound.</li>
        <li><strong>Week 12:</strong> Nuchal Translucency Scan (Screening).</li>
        <li><strong>Week 20:</strong> Anomaly Scan (Detailed structural check).</li>
        <li><strong>Week 24:</strong> Viability (Baby has a chance of survival if born now).</li>
        <li><strong>Week 37:</strong> Full Term (Baby is ready).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="accuracy">Is the Date Accurate? (The 5% Rule)</h2>
    <p>
        Only 5% of babies are born on their exact Estimated Due Date (EDD).
        <br>- Most first-time moms go "overdue" (40w +).
        <br>- Twins usually arrive early (36-37w).
        <br>Think of the EDD as the midpoint of a 4-week window. Anything from 38 to 42 weeks is normal.

    <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. My cycle is not 28 days. Is this accurate?</h4>
            <p>If your cycle is longer (e.g., 35 days), you ovulated later. Your real due date will be later than the
                calculator says. An early ultrasound dating scan is best for irregular cycles.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. What is "Gestational Age" vs "Fetal Age"?</h4>
            <p>Gestational Age is from LMP (used by doctors). Fetal Age is from conception (usually 2 weeks less).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. IVF Pregnancy?</h4>
            <p>For IVF, calculate from the "Transfer Date" (Day 3 or Day 5 embryo), as distinct from LMP.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>4. Is it safe to fly?</h4>
            <p>Usually yes, until 36 weeks for domestic and 28-32 weeks for international. Check airline policies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>5. Can I eat sushi/cheese?</h4>
            <p>Avoid raw fish (Mercury/Bacteria) and unpasteurized soft cheese (Listeria). Cooked sushi is fine.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>6. How much weight should I gain?</h4>
            <p>Depends on starting BMI. Average is 11-16 kg. Underweight moms need more; overweight moms need less.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>7. What is "Lightning"?</h4>
            <p>Near the end, the baby drops into the pelvis. You can breathe easier, but you have to pee more!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>8. Due date changed after scan?</h4>
            <p>The 12-week scan is the most accurate. Doctors often revise the EDD based on the baby's Crown-Rump Length
                (CRL).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>9. Induction?</h4>
            <p>If you go past 41/42 weeks, doctors may induce labor artificially to protect the baby.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>10. Gender?</h4>
            <p>NIPT blood test can tell at 10 weeks. Ultrasound shows it at 18-20 weeks.</p>
