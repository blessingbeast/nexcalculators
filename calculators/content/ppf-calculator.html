    <h1>PPF Calculator: The Golden Standard of Indian Saving</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        In the alphabet soup of investment options—Stocks, MFs, FDs, NPS, ULIPs—one acronym has stood the test of time
        since 1968: <strong>PPF (Public Provident Fund)</strong>. It is widely regarded as the single best
        debt-instrument for Indian citizens. Why? Because it is the only instrument that offers the "EEE" advantage
        (Exempt-Exempt-Exempt) combined with a Sovereign Guarantee. This <strong>PPF Calculator</strong> helps you
        project your tax-free wealth over the 15-year tenure.

    <h2 id="miracle">The Miracle of EEE (Triple Exempt)</h2>
    <p>
        Most investments are taxed at some stage.
        <br>- FDs are taxed on Interest.
        <br>- Stocks are taxed on Capital Gains (LTCG).
        <br>- NPS is taxed on Annuity.
        <br><br>
        <strong>PPF is different.</strong>
        <br>1. <strong>Investment is Tax-Free:</strong> Your contribution (up to ₹1.5L) is deductible u/s 80C.
        <br>2. <strong>Interest is Tax-Free:</strong> The interest you earn every year is NOT added to your income.
        <br>3. <strong>Maturity is Tax-Free:</strong> When you withdraw the corpus after 15 years, you pay ZERO tax.
        <br><br>
        This makes the effective return of a 7.1% PPF comparable to a 10% FD for someone in the highest tax bracket!
    </p>

    <h2 id="features">Key Features & Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tenure:</strong> 15 Years (mandatory lock-in).</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum Investment:</strong> ₹500 per year.</li>
        <li><strong>Maximum Investment:</strong> ₹1,50,000 per year. (You can invest more, but you won't get interest or
            80C benefit on the excess).</li>
        <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> Floating. Decided by the Ministry of Finance every quarter. Historically
            ranged from 12% (in 1999) to 7.1% (current).</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Profile:</strong> Risk-Free. Backed by the Government of India.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="strategy">The "5th of the Month" Strategy</h2>
    <p>
        This is a secret trick to maximize your PPF returns.
        <br><br>
        <strong>The Rule:</strong> Interest is calculated on the <em>lowest balance</em> in your account between the 5th
        and the last day of the month.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Scenario A:</strong> You invest ₹1.5 Lakhs on April 6th.
        <br>Result: The lowest balance between April 5th and 30th is your old balance. You earn ZERO interest on the new
        ₹1.5L for April. You lost 1 month of interest.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Scenario B:</strong> You invest ₹1.5 Lakhs on April 4th.
        <br>Result: The lowest balance between 5th and 30th includes your new deposit. You earn interest for April.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Always invest before the 5th. Ideally, invest the full ₹1.5 Lakhs lump sum on April
        1st to earn interest for the full financial year.
    </p>

    <h2 id="extension">Extension Rules: The Wealth Multiplier</h2>
    <p>
        What happens after 15 years? You have three choices:
        <br>1. <strong>Withdraw:</strong> Take the money and close the account.
        <br>2. <strong>Extend Without Contribution:</strong> Keep the money there. It continues to earn interest. You
        can withdraw anytime.
        <br>3. <strong>Extend With Contribution:</strong> Extend for blocks of 5 years. You can continue putting money
        in and taking 80C benefits.
        <br><br>
        Extending is powerful. By Year 15, your base is large. The compounding in the 16th-20th year is explosive. A
        person who extends PPF to 30 years can easily build a corpus of over ₹1 Crore with disciplined investing.
    </p>

    <h2 id="loan">Partial Withdrawal & Loan Facilities</h2>
    <p>
        Though it's a 15-year lock-in, PPF is not completely rigid.

        <br><strong>Partial Withdrawal:</strong> Available from the 7th financial year. You can withdraw 50% of the
        balance.
        <br><strong>Premature Closure:</strong> Allowed only after 5 years for serious reasons (Medical treatment of
        family, Higher education of children).
