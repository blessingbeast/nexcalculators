    <h1>Margin Calculator: Profit & Revenue Guide</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        In business, there are two numbers that keep CEOs awake at night: Revenue and Profit. But the bridge between
        them is <strong>Margin</strong>. Whether you are selling handmade crafts on Etsy or running a drop-shipping
        empire, understanding margins is the difference between going broke and getting rich. This calculator clears the
        confusion between "Margin" and "Markup"—the two most mixed-up terms in commerce.

    <h2 id="difference">Margin vs Markup: The Big Confusion</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Markup</strong> is the percentage you <em>add</em> to your cost to get the selling price.
        <br><strong>Margin</strong> is the percentage of the <em>selling price</em> that is profit.
        <br><br>
        <strong>The Scenario:</strong> You buy a sneaker for $100. You want to make $50 profit. You sell it for $150.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Markup Calculation:</strong>
        <br>(Profit / Cost) * 100
        <br>($50 / $100) * 100 = <strong>50% Markup</strong>.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Margin Calculation:</strong>
        <br>(Profit / Revenue) * 100
        <br>($50 / $150) * 100 = <strong>33.3% Margin</strong>.
        <br><br>
        <em>Key Takeaway:</em> Margin is always LOWER than Markup (as long as profit is positive). Investors care about
        Margin. Suppliers care about Markup.
    </p>

    <h2 id="gross-net">Gross Margin vs Net Margin</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Gross Margin:</strong> (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue.
        <br>COGS = Cost of Goods Sold (Direct materials, Direct labor).
        <br>This tells you if your <em>product</em> is profitable.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Net Margin:</strong> (Revenue - All Expenses) / Revenue.
        <br>All Expenses = Rent, Salaries, Electricity, Taxes, Marketing.
        <br>This tells you if your <em>business</em> is profitable.
        <br><br>
        You can have a high gross margin (selling software) but a negative net margin (spending too much on ads).
    </p>

    <h2 id="pricing">Psychological Pricing Strategies</h2>
    <p>
        Once you know your margin, how do you set price?
        <br><strong>Cost-Plus Pricing:</strong> Cost + Desired Markup. Safe, boring.
        <br><strong>Value-Based Pricing:</strong> Charge what the customer is willing to pay. (e.g., iPhone costs $400
        to make, sells for $1000. Huge margin).
        <br><strong>Loss Leader:</strong> Selling a product at negative margin (loss) to get customers in the door
        (e.g., Costco Hotdogs, Gillette Razors) so they buy other high-margin stuff (Razor blades).
    </p>

    <h2 id="volume">The Multiplier Effect of Volume</h2>
    <p>
        High Margin isn't always good.
        <br>Ferrari: Sell 10,000 cars/year at 20% margin. High Profit.
        <br>Walmart: Sell 1 Billion items/year at 2% margin. Massive Profit.
        <br>The "Golden Ratio" depends on your industry. Don't chase high margins if it kills your volume.
