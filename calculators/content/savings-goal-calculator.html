    <h1>Savings Goal Calculator: Dream it, Plan it</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        We all have goals. A dream wedding, a world tour, a new car, or a down payment for a house. But a goal without a
        plan is just a wish. This <strong>Savings Goal Calculator</strong> works backward: You tell it how much you need
        and when, and it tells you how much to save every month to get there.

    <h2>The Math of Discipline</h2>
    <p>
        Saving is not about what is left after spending. It is about spending what is left after saving.
        <br><strong>Formula:</strong> Monthly Savings = (Target Amount - Current Savings) / Months Remaining.
    </p>

    <h2>Where to Park Short-Term Savings?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>
                < 1 Year:</strong> Savings Account or Liquid Funds. Safety is priority.</li>
        <li><strong>1 - 3 Years:</strong> Recurring Deposit (RD) or Short Term Debt Funds.</li>
        <li><strong>> 5 Years:</strong> Equity Mutual Funds (SIP).</li>
    </ul>
